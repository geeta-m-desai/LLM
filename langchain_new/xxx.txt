Officers were called to Lowe Street in Whitmore Reans, Wolverhampton at 17:00 GMT on Thursday when a 17-year-old boy was found with stab wounds. Several minutes later a second call was made to police when a shotgun was fired twice in nearby Deveron Close. West Midlands Police believe the men, who have now been bailed, were linked to both incidents. The teenager remains in hospital in a stable condition, police said. DCI Chris Hanson said: We believe both of these offences were linked and were the result of a dispute between two groups. The shooting happened following an argument between a group and a lone man with a gun.
