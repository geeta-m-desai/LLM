TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?
TL;DR: ", How have you addressed your concerns about your partner's drinking with him,"I have expressed my concerns about my partner's drinking with him by having an open and honest conversation. I have shared how his behavior at the party made me and others uncomfortable, and explained that his comments and actions were not appropriate for the setting. I have also mentioned that his texts have been pushy and that I would prefer some distance. I have tried to communicate my feelings without being too harsh, as I don't want to hurt his feelings too much.",Seek professional help from a therapist or addiction specialist to find an appropriate way to discuss the situation and its potential consequences.,0.95544726,0.98267424,0.9545454545454546,0.9918274879455566,llamaindex
