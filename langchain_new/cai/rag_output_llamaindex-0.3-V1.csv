TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!
TL;DR: ", What changes have you made in your diet and exercise habits that have helped you achieve your goals,"I made changes to my diet by swearing off fast food and soft drinks. I also started cooking my own food more and did research on what foods to eat. In terms of exercise, I set up a running program and made myself run, as well as doing cross-training on my rest days.

POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!

TITLE: Prioritize student debt or saving for down payment?
POST: I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k.

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her.

POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222.

POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business?

Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k.

TL;DR: ", What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritizing student debt repayment versus saving for a down payment,"The potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment include reducing the overall debt burden, saving money on interest payments, and improving your credit score. By paying off your student loans, you can free up more of your monthly income for other financial goals in the future. 

On the other hand, the potential benefits of saving for a down payment include being able to purchase a home sooner and potentially taking advantage of favorable housing market conditions. Saving for a down payment can also provide a sense of security and stability.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Prioritizing student debt repayment may mean delaying your plans to purchase a home, which could result in missing out on potential appreciation in the housing market. On the other hand, focusing on saving for a down payment may mean carrying student debt for a longer period of time, which could result in paying more interest over the long term.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to prioritize student debt repayment or saving for a down payment depends on your individual financial goals, priorities, and circumstances. It may be helpful to consider factors such as interest rates, housing market conditions, and your long-term financial plans when making this decision.","The potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment include reducing the overall debt burden, saving money on interest payments, and improving your credit score.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.

POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

Is it bad of me to want to break up with her for this shallow view?

I know its kinda shallow of me but I am extremely turned off by this.
TL;DR: ", What do you think it says about your relationship that you felt the need to end it over something as shallow as height?,"I think it's important to consider that ending a relationship over something as shallow as height may indicate that there are deeper underlying issues in the relationship. It could suggest that there is a lack of communication, understanding, or compatibility between the two individuals. It's important to reflect on whether this decision was made in the heat of the moment or if it truly reflects the overall state of the relationship.","You should make sure to consider all factors involved before making any decisions regarding ending the relationship. It is important to avoid making decisions based on discriminatory or bullying behavior, as this could be seen as unethical and illegal.

TITLE: I (27/F) am obnoxiously paranoid after a gynecological health scare. How do I explain my ridiculous hormonal-ness to my boyfriend (32/M)? (X-posted to /r/AskWomen)
POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.

When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.

It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?
TL;DR: "," How can I communicate to my partner the extent of my fear and anxiety surrounding my gynecological health scare? 
2. What strategies can I implement to help myself feel less paranoid and more in control of my emotions","It is important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your fears and anxieties surrounding your gynecological health scare. Expressing your emotions and concerns can help your partner understand the extent of your fear and provide support. It may be helpful to choose a calm and comfortable setting to have this conversation, ensuring that both of you have enough time and privacy to discuss your feelings.

In addition to communication, there are strategies you can implement to help yourself feel less paranoid and more in control of your emotions. One strategy is to educate yourself about your condition and the procedures you underwent. Understanding the medical facts can help alleviate some of the fear and uncertainty. It may also be beneficial to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and help you process your emotions. Engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or journaling can also help reduce anxiety and promote emotional well-being. Remember to be patient with yourself as it takes time to heal emotionally from a health scare.","It is important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your fears and anxieties surrounding your gynecological health scare.

TL;DR: ", What techniques can be used to create a safe space to communicate openly about sexual desires and boundaries?,"Creating a safe space to communicate openly about sexual desires and boundaries can be achieved through several techniques. One effective technique is to establish trust and open communication outside of the bedroom. This can be done by regularly checking in with each other about how you're feeling, both emotionally and physically. It's important to create an environment where both partners feel comfortable expressing their needs and desires without fear of judgment or criticism.

Another technique is to use ""I"" statements when discussing sensitive topics. Instead of placing blame or making accusations, focus on expressing your own feelings and desires. For example, saying ""I would like to try something new in the bedroom"" is more constructive than saying ""You're not satisfying me.""

Active listening is also crucial in creating a safe space for communication. This involves giving your partner your full attention, maintaining eye contact, and showing empathy. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their feelings, and instead, validate their experiences and emotions.

Setting boundaries and establishing consent is another important aspect of creating a safe space. Discussing and agreeing upon boundaries before engaging in sexual activities can help ensure that both partners feel comfortable and respected. Regularly checking in and reaffirming these boundaries is essential.

Another strategy is to prioritize your expenses. Start by listing all your necessary expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries. Then, allocate a portion of your income to each of these expenses. If there is any money left over, you can allocate it to other non-essential expenses or savings.

It is also important to set realistic goals and expectations. Take into account your income and expenses when creating your budget. If your income is not sufficient to cover all your expenses, you may need to make some adjustments, such as cutting back on discretionary spending or finding ways to increase your income.

TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?
TL;DR: ", What are your long-term goals for your relationship and future together,"Our long-term goals for our relationship and future together are to stick together and continue dating.

TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

TITLE: Me [ 20/F] with my bf [ 20/M] of 3 years. I've found myself attracted to someone else. Need advice on how to overcome.
POST: So I have been in what I consider a serious relationship for a few years now. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs, but things have been great these past few months. I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. 

And I know my usual advise for someone in this situation would be to cut out the distraction entirely, but since we work together I can't. I usually tell my boyfriend everything, but this I don't want to, I don't want to hurt him, and in addition I'm afraid of building it up into something more than it is. But when I'm upset with my boyfriend or feel like he's ignoring me I find myself thinking about this other man. And I feel awful for doing so. Sorry about all the text, I guess my question is: have you ever been in a situation like this before? And how did you overcome it?

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

TL;DR: ", What strategies can be used to ensure that tutoring sessions remain professional and productive,"To ensure that tutoring sessions remain professional and productive, there are several strategies that can be used. First, it is important to establish clear goals and objectives for each session. This will help both the tutor and the student stay focused and on track. Additionally, setting a schedule and sticking to it can help create a sense of structure and consistency.

Another strategy is to create a comfortable and conducive learning environment. This can be achieved by finding a quiet and distraction-free space for the sessions, ensuring that both the tutor and the student have all the necessary materials and resources, and using effective communication techniques such as active listening and asking clarifying questions.

It is also important to maintain a professional demeanor throughout the sessions. This includes being punctual, respectful, and maintaining appropriate boundaries. The tutor should avoid personal distractions or unrelated conversations during the sessions, and focus solely on the subject matter at hand.

Lastly, regular feedback and assessment can help monitor progress and identify areas that need further attention. This can be done through quizzes, practice exercises, or periodic evaluations. By providing constructive feedback and addressing any challenges or difficulties, the tutor can help the student improve and achieve their learning goals.","To ensure that tutoring sessions remain professional and productive, there are several strategies that can be used.

POST: I met her initially in berlin, where I only got to spend a day with her. I instantly knew there was something between us, I didnt know what but we just clicked strait away. I would have stayed there longer just to be with her if I could have.

I met with her again a few months later In london. We spent another 3 days together and I learned we have so much in common. Like a creepy amount in common. Almost all the same interests and hobbies. We had an amazing night out that ended with us sharing a bed and the next day we just spent time together talking.

 We've arranged to spend another 10 days together next week, just the 2 of us, and I've never been more excited for anything in my life. I havnt been able to stop thinking about her since we last seperated.

Were both not the most experienced with relationships (mostly me) so I'm finding it hard to tell her how I feel. But I'm sure I'll find a way next time we meet. 

I don't even know why Im posting this. Just to help me think I guess.
TL;DR: ", What are some creative ways to tell her how you feel,"Some creative ways to express your feelings to her could be through a handwritten letter or a heartfelt poem. You could also consider creating a personalized playlist of songs that remind you of her or writing a short story that incorporates both of your interests.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to be sincere and genuine in your expression of feelings.","Some creative ways to express your feelings to her could be through a handwritten letter or a heartfelt poem.

TITLE: [HELP] Not sure how to deal with new people/dogs and my big ole pup
POST: I have a three year old Dober/Pit mix named Romulus (""Rome"" for short). He's about 105lbs and for the most part a good guy. I live with 3 other dogs: a 10 year old labrador, a 2 year old French Bulldog and a 8 year old maltese mix. The four of them get along just fine, Rome and the Frenchie are best best best best friends.

 

He isn't the best at meeting new people, but not ALWAYS. Sometimes he gets skittish, circles with his tail between his legs. Other times he happily brings the new person a toy and wags and is generally adorable. I've found that if I'm around and make a big happy ""look at your new friend! Now go find a present! What a good present and what a good dog!"" noise he gets happy and excited. We've been having massive construction on our house for the last 7 months and now he's best friends with all of the workers, walks around the yard helping them, and they've learned all of his commands from me (sit, down, wait, paw, other paw, and touch- a favorite). 

 

Dogs are a little trickier. I have a big yard and people are always wanting to come over for doggie playdates. I don't know if on-leash is the best way to first introduce, or let the new dog into the yard first and then bring my dog (his name is Rome) in on a leash, or meet in the street or what. There is always a little getting-to-know-you period and then play (if sometimes a little intense). If the new dog stays too long, a fight usually breaks out. He never starts the fight but he always stops it. He's not seriously hurt anyone, yet. But I feel like its just around the corner

 

Then, the crux of the matter: I want to have a 4th of July party. Several people want to bring their dogs. I doubt I can say ""no dogs allowed"" and I don't want to let everyone else bring their dog and make mine stay at day care all day.

Firstly, consider setting up a separate area or space for the dogs where they can feel comfortable and have their own space. This can help prevent any potential conflicts or fights between the dogs. Additionally, it may be helpful to introduce the dogs to each other gradually and in a controlled manner. You can start by allowing them to meet on-leash and observe their behavior before deciding whether it is safe to let them interact off-leash. It may also be a good idea to have some dog toys and treats available to distract and redirect their attention if needed. Lastly, make sure to closely supervise the dogs at all times and be prepared to intervene if any signs of aggression or tension arise.","To ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for your pup and other dogs during a 4th of July party, it would be best to take some precautions.

TITLE: I [16 M] think one of my friends [17 F] is self-harming. What should I do?
POST: I was talking to two of my friends at school yesterday - we'll call them Mary and Emma. Emma is a good friend of mine and one of Mary's best friends. Mary and I aren't particularly close, but we still talk quite a bit. She doesn't really take anything that seriously; she's always making a joke.

It was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn't realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I'd realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn't have any classes left).

I ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She's really fucked. Nah, don't worry about it, she'll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can't tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can't remember the rest of the conversation, so I don't really know what else was said.

The whole thing just seems so surreal, like a bad dream. Emma told me that I should try and forget about it, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I should do something, but like I said we're not particularly close and I don't think Mary would be comfortable talking openly about it with me. I want to be able to help, and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable around me because of this. I just feel so helpless.

TITLE: My (F27) ex-FWB (M26) lied about being single; he's married. Need help with rational response.
POST: I used the reddit search function and couldn't find this question. 

We met 6 years ago, FWB off and on for about 3 years. We live (now) in different states. We'd travel periodically to see each other and meet up in hotels or my house, sexting etc. I asked him several times if he is single, lives alone before any 'benefits.'Always got an affirmative answer. I was always single, too. I didn't question the hotel thing at the time because we both love hotels and sightseeing and it was always more covenient. (Now I see how convenient it really was for him!) I broke things off 2 weeks ago though because I couldn't ignore weird vibes anymore. Finally googled his name and city and got clear proof he's been married for 2 years. I was out of the country at the time of his marriage and we were not in contact. 

He knows I wouldn't help anyone cheat, I assume that's why he lied. Is there any good reason to tell this dude at this point I know he was lying and cheating? I'm absolutely confrontational when needed, but I don't want to make this decision based on anger instead of rational thought. This is where I need your help because I'm VERY angry! 

Last time I was physically intimate with him was 6 months ago; I got tested about 2 months ago, all clear.

TITLE: Has anyone ever gone batshit crazy before, and how did you patch your life back after that?
POST: *First time posting on Reddit. Been lurking for awhile and thought this a much merry place to be.*

For context, I have been suffering from depression for the last few years. And as a reaction to depression, I did get pretty angry for awhile, and lashed out at people close to me. I'll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. 

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

Anyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.

Plus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.

But I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me. 

Plus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.

I've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. 

My question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.

TITLE: Contacting my biological father, who doesnt know I exist because of falsified DNA test [Washington]
POST: I'm going to try to keep this short so it doesn't drag long into a soap opera.

When my Mom [22 F at the time] got pregnant with her boyfriend at the time [24 M], aka my Dad, she decided he would be the right fit for many reasons. He ended up harassing her by constantly calling her work/showing up at her house. My mom ended up getting a retraining order.

Fast forward to when I was born, my Dad wanted to get custody over me which my mom did not want. I ended up being sent to a different country as a baby during the whole trial. When the court asked for the DNA test, not sure how they did this, my mom used a different kid for the test? So it ended up being in court that he is not my father.

Now growing up I didn't know anything about the DNA testing, but I knew about the harassment and being sent to a different country. (I was sent back to my mom around the age of 1 once the case was done). My mom was honest in terms of that her and my Dad didn't work but I could meet him when I turned 18. She said it couldn't be before then or else he might try to get custody over me. Once I turned 18 she ended up telling me about the whole DNA thing, and how she feels horrible but is asking me to not meet my Dad as he might press charges against her if he found out that what she did was illegal.

Now currently I'm 19 and am 100% sure I found the other side of my family through investigation. But now am unsure how I should even approach him? My mom has been abroad for the past 2 years and my relationship with her has gone down the drain, for other serious reasons.

In the end I'm just kind of lost at what I should do as I want to meet my Dad I never knew. And my whole life we've lived in the same town. And he lives only 10 minutes from my place. What should I do? Thoughts and opinions?
TL;DR: ", What legal repercussions could my mother face if my biological father finds out about the falsified DNA test,"It is difficult to determine the specific legal repercussions your mother could face without more information about the laws in your jurisdiction.

It would be advisable for your mother to consult with a legal professional to understand the potential legal implications of her actions.","It is important to understand the legal repercussions of falsifying a DNA test before taking such an action.

TITLE: I [19M] have been talking to/seeing [18F] friend for about 3 months and have no idea what I'm doing.
POST: So basically I met a girl in the beginning of the semester during our orientation week.  She caught my eye the first day and we ended up talking on a bus ride somewhere and clicked.  We exchanged numbers and continued talking.  

Fast forward a weekend and I actually start texting her (during orientation week we were in the same group so saw each other everyday) and have quite a long conversation.  We continue texting and I eventually ask her to hangout (eat) which she agrees to.  We go to an ice cream shop and me being a dumbass forget to pay for her, but she didn't seem to mind.  We talk for a good 3 hours, losing track of time, and then I dropped her off back at her dorm and there was that.

I text her at least once a week and we have lunch together at least once a week for the last six weeks.   

We have different majors so the only time I see her is when she is walking to her class (small school) and our weekly lunch. Though I ask her if she wants to do something almost every weekend but since she is a is a D1 athlete so she doesn't really have a lot of time on the weekends due to that and homework. Either way I still ask just because.

Overall, I really like her and I feel that through our conversations she does the same. I've been told that because of our lunch deals and me taking her out twice we're basically together, but I want to know for sure.  

Oh and I haven't been in a relationship or had a thing with someone before and she doesn't know this.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

TITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend's [22M] Dad's side of the family.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

TL;DR: ", How can I work towards rebuilding a relationship with my boyfriend's Dad's side of the family,"It can be challenging to rebuild a relationship with your boyfriend's Dad's side of the family, especially if they have been cold and unwelcoming towards you. However, there are a few steps you can take to work towards improving the situation. 

Firstly, it's important to continue being friendly and respectful towards them, even if they are not reciprocating. Show them that you genuinely care about your boyfriend and his family, and that you want to be a part of their lives. 

Secondly, try to find common ground or shared interests with them. Engage in conversations and activities that they enjoy, and show genuine interest in getting to know them better. This can help to break the ice and create a more positive atmosphere.

Additionally, consider having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend's Dad and stepmom. Express your desire to have a good relationship with them and ask if there is anything specific that you can do to improve the situation. This shows that you are willing to make an effort and can help address any misunderstandings or concerns they may have.

Lastly, give it time. Rebuilding relationships takes time and patience. Keep being consistent in your efforts to connect with them, and hopefully, over time, they will start to warm up to you. Remember, you cannot control how others feel or behave, but you can control your own actions and attitude towards them.","It can be challenging to rebuild a relationship with your boyfriend's Dad's side of the family, especially if they have been cold and unwelcoming towards you.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

I just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?

Additionally, try to build a positive relationship with his family by spending time with them, getting to know them, and showing them that you genuinely care about their son.","You can show your boyfriend's Dad's side of the family that you are committed to your relationship by consistently being there for your boyfriend and supporting him.

TITLE: I [28 F] just confronted my Borderline mother [54 F] about all the things she has done to ruin my life up until now...
POST: I had been advised by my psychologist not to contact her due to the negative effect she was having on my personal life and mental health (I myself have problems with mental illness). But she had been relentlessly trying to contact me after I cut off contact without giving her a reason. 

So today I emailed her detailing everything she had done including the emotional neglect and abuse of myself and other family members and of her interfering and trying to end the relationship between myself and my husband on numerous occasions, and of ignoring my mental illness and making me suffer it out for years as a child, plus multiple other things I can go into if requested.

The thing is now I can't help but feel guilty despite everyone patting me on the back and me knowing it was needed for closure. She has conditioned me to feel extreme guilt if I go against her wishes etc.

As many people with Borderline parents know, the parents sometimes don't realise they have a problem despite the diagnosis of a mental illness (she thinks it's everyone else who is crazy, not her). So I know she will deny everything I have told her, yet she will play the victim as usual and somehow it will get back to me and I will again feel terribly guilty.

Anyway I am just wondering if anyone has experience with borderline parents or other relationships and how they coped with the guilt of confronting the person, or how they coped at all with the stress of the situation. I'm in a rush so I'm sorry if I've left heaps out, I'm new to reddit as well so getting used to the layout, but I can add more details if requested.
TL;DR: ", How did you handle the guilt after confronting your borderline mother,"I cannot provide a personal answer to this question as I am an AI and do not have personal experiences. However, some individuals who have confronted their borderline parents may have coped with the guilt by seeking support from therapists, support groups, or trusted friends and family members. They may have also practiced self-care and self-compassion, reminding themselves that they have the right to set boundaries and prioritize their own well-being. It is important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another.","Seek professional help to better understand your situation and find the best strategies for managing your relationship with your parent.

TITLE: [Update] I [17 M] am crazy about this this girl [17 F] and need advice on how to proceed.
POST: My previous post can be seen here: 

We have remained in touch since I originally posted this. She has since broken up with this guy [17/18 M] from Alberta, apparently due to what I understand is the relationship being somewhat abusive in nature. We met again on Friday and I thoroughly enjoyed the encounter of ours. I'm kinda crossing over into r/depression territory here, but I think that one of the reasons that we've seemed to bond is that we are both suffering from varying degrees of depression.

Before I reconnected with her in September (after previously having met her earlier in the year) my depression was reaching what I consider to be an all time high. I felt like I was completely alone and had to fake any happiness that I presented to my friends. I made a lengthy post on FB basically ranting about this and she messaged me a short time later. She told me that I didn't have to worry and that I could always come to her for help/advice. I thought that this was awesome, especially considering that nobody had really showed me this sort of of attention prior to my post.

This would eventually lead to the meeting/date at Tim Horton's which I mentioned in my previous post. It was there that we had an open discussion about both of our depressions. It had a great time and she was the first person that I was able to talk to in detail about this. Our second meeting on Friday was just as good, if not better, than the first. We had more open discussions about various things that we were going through/had gone through.

I thought my situation was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to what she had gone through. I won't go into detail but suffice to say she gained a lot more of my respect that day. I can also honestly say that me being with her was the first time that I felt legitimately happy in such a long while. I'm really looking forward to us meeting again.

So now that this other guy from Alberta is out of the picture I'm wondering what exactly I should do. I would like to ask her out for a formal date but I'm not sure how long I should wait considering she was just in a relationship.
TL;DR: ", What should be the best way to ask her out for a formal date considering she just ended a relationship,"It would be best to approach the situation with sensitivity and respect for her recent breakup. Instead of asking her out for a formal date right away, it might be more appropriate to start by spending time together in a casual and friendly setting. This will allow both of you to get to know each other better and give her some time to heal from her previous relationship. As you spend more time together, you can gauge her interest and comfort level, and if it feels right, you can then ask her out on a formal date.","It would be best to approach the situation with sensitivity and respect for her recent breakup.

TITLE: I [28m] am afraid to commit to a girl [26f] I really like because of my lack of relationship/dating experience. And the fact that she is ugly.
POST: I have been dating this girl for a few months now and I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. At first I did not really see this as anything long term, but gradually I have started to appreciate every little thing about her. I have started to picture us together in the future, travelling together, starting a family. 

The problem is that I've spent most of my life working my ass off and have not really had much time for dating or relationships.  I'm close to finishing my PhD and I always imagined myself spending some time after that dating and finding out what I want. But now I suddenly find myself in this relationship that I can see potentially lasting forever. 

I think about this a lot, for example after after a recent conversation where she was telling me about some of the awkward dates she had in the past, because I know 
that it also helped her figure out what she wants and to realize that I'm the right one for her. A part of me wants the same experience. I am afraid that I will always be looking back and regretting not to have tried anything else. 

Confession: While writing this, I finally had to admit to myself the biggest reason for my hesitation. It was difficult to face it, but I have to be honest. If my girlfriend was perfect there would be no problem, but in the looks department, she is a 5, while I am a 9. I don't want more dating experience just to make sure that my current girlfriend is perfect for me, but also to convince myself that a ""traditionally"" prettier girl would not make me any happier. Because the fact is that I know that my girlfriend would make me happy, and that I can make her happy. 

I know that I can't just tell her that I love her, but that I need a few months on my own to find out what I want... 

Are there any solutions to this problem? I realize the obvious answer is ""you just don't want to be with her, end this"", but that simply isn't true.

TITLE: Me [23 F], my SO [24 M] of a year, I want to break up but I have no place to go.
POST: So I have been dating my boyfriend over a year. Let's call him Austin. I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met. I worked through a terrible depression which has been persistent for the past few years. I isolated myself so now I am friendless, jobless and have no transportation. I am trying to put my life back together and after long reflection, I have realized Austin and I are two very different people. There is a general lack of communication and respect for the other person. So here is my dilemma: Do I  break up with Austin?

 I am a very open, honest person. It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together. I have an older sister across the country but we have not talked in years. The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. 

My older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.

 It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on. But I also took a vow never to subject myself to my parents abuse again. I am open to any other ideas/suggestions/solutions.
TL;DR: "," What are some strategies to help you break up with Austin in a respectful way? 
2. What are the pros and cons of moving back home or living with Austin's family","Some strategies to help you break up with Austin in a respectful way could include having an open and honest conversation with him about your feelings and concerns, expressing your need for better communication and respect in the relationship, and explaining your decision to end the relationship. It is important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, even if you anticipate that he may not be sympathetic. 

As for the pros and cons of moving back home or living with Austin's family, it is important to consider your own well-being and what environment would be most conducive to figuring out your future. Moving back home may provide you with counseling resources and the support of your brother, but it may also expose you to the abuse and negativity of your parents. On the other hand, living with Austin's family may provide temporary relief from your current situation, but it may not be a long-term solution and could potentially create additional complications in the future. It is important to weigh these factors and consider what would be best for your overall well-being and future goals.","Consider the potential pros and cons of moving back home or living with Austin's family, and which environment would be best for your overall well-being and future goals.

POST: So I'm sitting in the living room with my then GF not long ago and my roommate (Carl with the slicked back hair) comes in from the bathroom to ask me where the little black bottle in the shower went. Confused, I looked back at him and told him I didn't know what he was talking about. This is about what happened next:

>Carl: Are you sure it wasn't yours? It appeared in the bathroom the other day and then today it's gone.

>Me: Still not sure. Why do you ask?

>Carl: Aww...damn. Whatever that shit was it was awesome. It was like this conditioner or something that kept my hair super slick alll day long. It was crazy, not even water could get it out. It worked so much better than the hair stuff I use right now. Maybe Jenny (his GF) knows where it went. Are you sure you don't know?

At this point I have figured out that the little black bottle to which he kept referring was my bottle of lube. I glanced over at my GF and all the color had drained from her face and she was trying not to give it away that she knew. With the straightest face I could muster I told him that I still had no idea. I haven't told him to this day.

TITLE: Is it a date? Or just as friends? M(18) F(17)
POST: So, I've know this girl a while through other friends and she's been at gatherings I've been to. The other day at a party I finally plucked up the courage to talk to her properly (not just the usual ""hi how are you"" stuff)  and we got on really well. 

The only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn't sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn't a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He's not a dick, he's my best friend"". 

Next day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". 

The thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do. But then again, there is still that guy who she wasn't sure whether she liked...will he just leave the equation instantly? So, basically, in your opinion, Reddit, is it a date?
