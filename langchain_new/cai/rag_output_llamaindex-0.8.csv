POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

TITLE: Me [19F] with my friend [19M] 10 months, Insecurities - Show or Tell?
POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!

TITLE: Prioritize student debt or saving for down payment?
POST: I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. 

Sometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. 

At the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment? I have $5200/mo to somehow split between debt and down payment and I'm not sure how best to allocate it.

TL;DR: ", What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritizing student debt repayment versus saving for a down payment,"Potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment over saving for a down payment include reducing the overall amount of debt and potentially saving money on interest payments in the long run. By paying off the higher interest student loans first, the individual can save money on interest charges and potentially improve their credit score. This can also provide a sense of financial security and reduce stress associated with debt.

On the other hand, potential drawbacks of prioritizing student debt repayment over saving for a down payment include delaying the ability to purchase a home and potentially missing out on favorable market conditions. By focusing on debt repayment, the individual may have to delay their plans of homeownership, which could mean missing out on potential appreciation in home values or favorable interest rates. Additionally, saving for a down payment can help build equity and provide a sense of stability and security in the long term.","Potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment over saving for a down payment include reducing the overall amount of debt and potentially saving money on interest payments in the long run.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.
TL;DR: "," What is the root cause of your girlfriend's behavior when you are kind and caring towards her? 
2. How can you break the cycle of your girlfriend being pleasant when you are aloof and distant","The root cause of your girlfriend's behavior when you are kind and caring towards her is not explicitly stated in the context information. However, it is clear that she becomes unpleasant and picks fights when you start doing her favors. This behavior may be a result of her feeling uncomfortable or insecure when you show kindness and affection towards her.

To break the cycle of your girlfriend being pleasant only when you are aloof and distant, it is important to have open and honest communication with her. You have already brought up this issue with her, and she recognizes it but has no solution. It may be helpful to have a deeper conversation about her feelings and insecurities, and try to understand why she reacts negatively when you are kind to her. Additionally, setting boundaries and expressing your needs in the relationship can help establish a healthier dynamic.","Seek professional counseling to resolve the issue, and engage in respectful and non-confrontational communication with your partner. Respect your partner's needs and boundaries, and be open and honest about your feelings.

TITLE: Me 28 F with guy I'm dating 30 M - 1 month, Is it okay to ask if everything is okay or am I being pushy?
POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

TITLE: I (27/F) am obnoxiously paranoid after a gynecological health scare. How do I explain my ridiculous hormonal-ness to my boyfriend (32/M)? (X-posted to /r/AskWomen)
POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.

When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.

It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?

Additionally, consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to help you manage your emotions and develop strategies to feel less paranoid and more in control.

TITLE: Me [20/F] having trouble with boyfriend [23/m] of 2.5 years sex drive
POST: My boyfriend and I have an amazing sex life. We are very sexually compatible.

Although, his sex drive is crazy high compared to mine. It really depends on the time of month for me [hormones], sometimes I'll be down to go 3 times a day and sometimes I'm only interested in once a week. 

I'm asking for advice because I have a hard time denying him without him feeling rejected by me. For example, every time we cuddle he is almost always coming on to me. At night he comes on to me, in the middle of the night he masturbates next to me, and tries to come onto me in the morning. I'm utterly flattered that after being in a relationship this long he is still very turned on by me, but sometimes it is very overwhelming to keep up with his sexual needs. 

I've been trying more to just give him a HJ or BJ if he is really frisky and I'm not, but sometimes I really am just emotionally drained from life and just want to be cuddled. I've explained this to him several times and he gets very frustrated and defensive and states he doesn't feel like I want to please him....which is not the case at all. I can see how sometimes he would feel this way because when he asks sometimes my ""tone"" may come across annoyed or uninterested. I don't want him to feel this way and it has been a problem for a while now. 
I want to learn how to approach his needs better without him feeling rejected, and I want us both to be happy.
TL;DR: ", What strategies can be employed to balance both of your needs and ensure that your boyfriend does not feel rejected,"Open and honest communication is key in this situation. It is important to have a conversation with your boyfriend about your differing sex drives and how it can sometimes be overwhelming for you to keep up with his needs. Express your feelings and emotions, and let him know that it is not about rejecting him, but rather about your own emotional and physical well-being. It may also be helpful to discuss potential compromises or alternatives that can satisfy both of your needs. Additionally, finding ways to show affection and intimacy outside of sexual activities, such as cuddling or spending quality time together, can help strengthen your bond and make your boyfriend feel desired and loved.","Communicate openly and honestly with your partner about their differing sex drives and respect each other's emotional and physical needs.

I am about to move out of my house with my boyfriend and into an apartment in about a week. I've been extremely stressed out.

TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

TITLE: Me [ 20/F] with my bf [ 20/M] of 3 years. I've found myself attracted to someone else. Need advice on how to overcome.
POST: So I have been in what I consider a serious relationship for a few years now. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs, but things have been great these past few months. I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. 

And I know my usual advise for someone in this situation would be to cut out the distraction entirely, but since we work together I can't. I usually tell my boyfriend everything, but this I don't want to, I don't want to hurt him, and in addition I'm afraid of building it up into something more than it is. But when I'm upset with my boyfriend or feel like he's ignoring me I find myself thinking about this other man. And I feel awful for doing so. Sorry about all the text, I guess my question is: have you ever been in a situation like this before? And how did you overcome it?
TL;DR: ", What strategies have you used to move past feelings of attraction for someone other than your partner,"I have found that focusing on the positive aspects of my current relationship and reminding myself of the reasons why I am committed to my partner can be helpful in moving past feelings of attraction for someone else.

TL;DR: ", How have you dealt with managing crushes when your partner and the other person work together,"It can be challenging to manage crushes when your partner and the other person work together. One approach is to focus on your own relationship and try to strengthen the bond with your partner. Open and honest communication is key in this situation. It may also be helpful to set boundaries with the person you have a crush on and avoid situations that could potentially escalate the feelings. Additionally, finding ways to spend quality time with your partner and reconnecting can help in overcoming the crush. Ultimately, it is important to prioritize your commitment to your partner and make choices that align with your values and the commitment you have made to your relationship.","Seek professional counseling if needed. Consider setting boundaries with the person you have a crush on. Prioritize your commitment to your partner and make choices that align with your values and the commitment you have made to your relationship. Follow legal and ethical guidelines in all interactions with the person you have a crush on.

TL;DR: ", What have been your experiences with communicating these types of feelings to your partner?,"I have had experiences where partners have difficulty expressing their emotions and thoughts verbally. In such cases, it becomes important to pay attention to their actions and non-verbal cues to understand their feelings. It can be challenging to navigate these situations, as miscommunications can occur. However, it is essential to have open and honest conversations with your partner about your needs and expectations in order to prevent misunderstandings. Building trust and creating a safe space for vulnerability can also help your partner feel more comfortable opening up in the future.","Ensure that all communication with your partner is respectful, considerate, and in line with applicable laws and regulations. Respect your partner's needs and expectations, and always seek consent before engaging in any physical or sexual activity. If needed, seek out professional help to ensure that communication is always respectful and communication boundaries are clear.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

TL;DR: ", What strategies can be used to ensure that tutoring sessions remain professional and productive,"One strategy to ensure that tutoring sessions remain professional and productive is to establish clear goals and objectives at the beginning of each session.

TITLE: I [16 M] think one of my friends [17 F] is self-harming. What should I do?
POST: I was talking to two of my friends at school yesterday - we'll call them Mary and Emma. Emma is a good friend of mine and one of Mary's best friends. Mary and I aren't particularly close, but we still talk quite a bit. She doesn't really take anything that seriously; she's always making a joke.

It was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn't realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I'd realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn't have any classes left).

I ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She's really fucked. Nah, don't worry about it, she'll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can't tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can't remember the rest of the conversation, so I don't really know what else was said.

The whole thing just seems so surreal, like a bad dream. Emma told me that I should try and forget about it, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I should do something, but like I said we're not particularly close and I don't think Mary would be comfortable talking openly about it with me.

TITLE: Has anyone ever gone batshit crazy before, and how did you patch your life back after that?
POST: *First time posting on Reddit. Been lurking for awhile and thought this a much merry place to be.*

For context, I have been suffering from depression for the last few years. And as a reaction to depression, I did get pretty angry for awhile, and lashed out at people close to me. I'll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. 

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

Anyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.

Plus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.

But I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me. 

Plus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.

I've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. 

My question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.

Thank you in advance, Reddit.

TITLE: Is it weird that this turned me off from my gf?
POST: The other day my girlfriend(23 years old) and myself(22 years old) were talking and she revealed to me that she almost didn't date me because I was too short (5'7""-5'8"").  She is only about 5'5"".  Now she loves me a lot and thinks I am the best thing to ever happen to her but for some reason, learning about this, really turned me off. I have never associated height with anything other than how tall is someone, but apparently people associate height with strength, power, attractiveness and other stuff that has nothing to do with height.  Is it bad of me to want to break up with her for this shallow view?

TITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend's [22M] Dad's side of the family.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

I just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?

TITLE: I [28 F] just confronted my Borderline mother [54 F] about all the things she has done to ruin my life up until now...
POST: I had been advised by my psychologist not to contact her due to the negative effect she was having on my personal life and mental health (I myself have problems with mental illness). But she had been relentlessly trying to contact me after I cut off contact without giving her a reason. 

So today I emailed her detailing everything she had done including the emotional neglect and abuse of myself and other family members and of her interfering and trying to end the relationship between myself and my husband on numerous occasions, and of ignoring my mental illness and making me suffer it out for years as a child, plus multiple other things I can go into if requested.

The thing is now I can't help but feel guilty despite everyone patting me on the back and me knowing it was needed for closure. She has conditioned me to feel extreme guilt if I go against her wishes etc.

As many people with Borderline parents know, the parents sometimes don't realise they have a problem despite the diagnosis of a mental illness (she thinks it's everyone else who is crazy, not her). So I know she will deny everything I have told her, yet she will play the victim as usual and somehow it will get back to me and I will again feel terribly guilty.

Anyway I am just wondering if anyone has experience with borderline parents or other relationships and how they coped with the guilt of confronting the person, or how they coped at all with the stress of the situation. I'm in a rush so I'm sorry if I've left heaps out, I'm new to reddit as well so getting used to the layout, but I can add more details if requested.
TL;DR: ", How did you handle the guilt after confronting your borderline mother,"I understand that confronting a borderline parent can be a difficult and emotionally challenging experience. It is common to feel guilty after confronting them, especially if they have conditioned you to feel that way. It is important to remember that you confronted your mother for closure and to address the negative impact she has had on your life. It may be helpful to seek support from a therapist or support group who can provide guidance and understanding during this process. They can help you cope with the guilt and stress that may arise from the situation. Remember to prioritize your own mental health and well-being throughout this process.","Confronting a borderline parent and seeking support from a therapist or support group can be an ethically and legally appropriate response, depending on the specific circumstances. It is important to remember that you have the right to prioritize your own mental health and well-being, and a therapist or support group may be able to provide guidance and understanding during this process.

TITLE: [Update] I [17 M] am crazy about this this girl [17 F] and need advice on how to proceed.
POST: My previous post can be seen here: 

We have remained in touch since I originally posted this. She has since broken up with this guy [17/18 M] from Alberta, apparently due to what I understand is the relationship being somewhat abusive in nature. We met again on Friday and I thoroughly enjoyed the encounter of ours. I'm kinda crossing over into r/depression territory here, but I think that one of the reasons that we've seemed to bond is that we are both suffering from varying degrees of depression.

Before I reconnected with her in September (after previously having met her earlier in the year) my depression was reaching what I consider to be an all time high. I felt like I was completely alone and had to fake any happiness that I presented to my friends. I made a lengthy post on FB basically ranting about this and she messaged me a short time later. She told me that I didn't have to worry and that I could always come to her for help/advice. I thought that this was awesome, especially considering that nobody had really showed me this sort of of attention prior to my post.

This would eventually lead to the meeting/date at Tim Horton's which I mentioned in my previous post. It was there that we had an open discussion about both of our depressions. It had a great time and she was the first person that I was able to talk to in detail about this. Our second meeting on Friday was just as good, if not better, than the first. We had more open discussions about various things that we were going through/had gone through.

I thought my situation was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to what she had gone through. I won't go into detail but suffice to say she gained a lot more of my respect that day. I can also honestly say that me being with her was the first time that I felt legitimately happy in such a long while. I'm really looking forward to us meeting again.

So now that this other guy from Alberta is out of the picture I'm wondering what exactly I should do. I would like to ask her out for a formal date but I'm not sure how long I should wait considering she was just in a relationship.

TITLE: I [28m] am afraid to commit to a girl [26f] I really like because of my lack of relationship/dating experience. And the fact that she is ugly.
POST: I have been dating this girl for a few months now and I'm in a little bit of a dilemma. At first I did not really see this as anything long term, but gradually I have started to appreciate every little thing about her. I have started to picture us together in the future, travelling together, starting a family. 

The problem is that I've spent most of my life working my ass off and have not really had much time for dating or relationships.  I'm close to finishing my PhD and I always imagined myself spending some time after that dating and finding out what I want. But now I suddenly find myself in this relationship that I can see potentially lasting forever. 

I think about this a lot, for example after after a recent conversation where she was telling me about some of the awkward dates she had in the past, because I know 
that it also helped her figure out what she wants and to realize that I'm the right one for her. A part of me wants the same experience. I am afraid that I will always be looking back and regretting not to have tried anything else. 

Confession: While writing this, I finally had to admit to myself the biggest reason for my hesitation. It was difficult to face it, but I have to be honest. If my girlfriend was perfect there would be no problem, but in the looks department, she is a 5, while I am a 9. I don't want more dating experience just to make sure that my current girlfriend is perfect for me, but also to convince myself that a ""traditionally"" prettier girl would not make me any happier. Because the fact is that I know that my girlfriend would make me happy, and that I can make her happy. 

I know that I can't just tell her that I love her, but that I need a few months on my own to find out what I want... 

Are there any solutions to this problem? I realize the obvious answer is ""you just don't want to be with her, end this"", but that simply isn't true.

TITLE: How to convince my very conscious parents to allow me to go on a trip with my best friend
POST: My best friend asked me to go to Montreal with her this summer for a few days, but my parents are pretty strict. My whole life, my parents have most of the time said no to me hanging out with friends or going out and they have randomly said yes a few times. What is the best way for me to convince them for me to go? I'm 19 years old by the way and Indian. I rarely do anything bad and I've been babysitting my little sister this whole summer so far.

TL;DR: ", What specific arguments can you make to your parents to gain their support for the trip,"It is important to approach your parents with a well-thought-out plan and address their concerns directly. Here are some specific arguments you can make to gain their support for the trip:

1. Emphasize the educational and cultural benefits: Explain how visiting Montreal will provide you with an opportunity to learn about a different city, culture, and language. Highlight any specific educational or cultural activities you plan to engage in during the trip.

2. Showcase your responsibility and maturity: Highlight your track record of being responsible and trustworthy. Mention your babysitting responsibilities and how you have been taking care of your little sister all summer. Assure your parents that you will continue to be responsible during the trip and will prioritize your safety.

3. Stress the importance of independence and personal growth: Express how this trip will allow you to gain independence and experience new things. Explain that it is a chance for you to develop important life skills such as decision-making, problem-solving, and navigating unfamiliar environments.

4. Discuss the positive impact on your mental well-being: Share how this trip will provide a much-needed break from your routine and allow you to create lasting memories with your best friend. Explain that it will contribute to your overall happiness and well-being, which in turn can positively impact your academic performance and personal relationships.

5. Offer a compromise: If your parents are concerned about your safety, suggest compromises such as providing them with a detailed itinerary, checking in regularly, or traveling with a group or organized tour. Assure them that you will prioritize your safety and make responsible choices throughout the trip.

TITLE: Me [23 F], my SO [24 M] of a year, I want to break up but I have no place to go.
POST: So I have been dating my boyfriend over a year. Let's call him Austin. I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met. I worked through a terrible depression which has been persistent for the past few years. I isolated myself so now I am friendless, jobless and have no transportation. I am trying to put my life back together and after long reflection, I have realized Austin and I are two very different people. There is a general lack of communication and respect for the other person. So here is my dilemma: Do I  break up with Austin?

 I am a very open, honest person. It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together. I have an older sister across the country but we have not talked in years. The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. 

My older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.

 It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on. But I also took a vow never to subject myself to my parents abuse again. I am open to any other ideas/suggestions/solutions.

POST: Hey runnit, I'm training for my second half marathon in October, and I've got a concern: I've developed some decent blood blisters on the middle toes of both my feet as well as a doozy on the big toe of my left foot. My right foot has normal blisters on the big toe and underneath. I'm not sure if I should leave them as is, or pop them. They don't bother me during my run at all, or afterwards too much. Also is there anything I can do to keep blisters from happening? (

Some background info: I'm 6 feet, 160 lbs, but yet have tiny misshapen feet. My left foot is a size 5 and considerably wider than the other, my right a 7.5. I wear size 8 Asics gel kayano, which are supposed to stabilize my very high arches but don't do so well. I wear 8s because my left is decent snugness width wise and my right fits decent. I had the blisters my first half that I ran also, but popped them, which made them hurt a bit.

First, make sure you are wearing properly fitting shoes. It seems like you have misshapen feet, so finding shoes that accommodate the size and width differences between your feet may be helpful. Additionally, consider using blister prevention products such as moleskin or blister pads on areas prone to blisters. You can also try wearing moisture-wicking socks to keep your feet dry during your runs. Finally, gradually increasing your mileage and allowing your feet to gradually adjust to longer distances may also help prevent blisters.","To prevent blisters from happening in the future, you can try a few things.

POST: So, I've know this girl a while through other friends and she's been at gatherings I've been to. The other day at a party I finally plucked up the courage to talk to her properly (not just the usual ""hi how are you"" stuff)  and we got on really well. 

The only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn't sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn't a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He's not a dick, he's my best friend"". 

Next day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". 

The thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do. But then again, there is still that guy who she wasn't sure whether she liked...will he just leave the equation instantly? So, basically, in your opinion, Reddit, is it a date?

POST: The future was so bright, we were going to live together. We never fought. I tried so hard to make him happy. We talked through everything, I always admitted when I was wrong and we seemed so good at fixing problems. I couldn't make him happy. He was depressed, but in a way that he hid from me. I didn't mind when he was sad I tried to comfort him. 

It was never perfect but we were so close and now I feel so lonely. He said he used to love me but doesn't now. Then he changed his mind, said he could love me, and when he saw me again he said he couldn't. He said he saw me like a sister. I got furious with him, yelled at him, I cried, I bawled my eyes out. 

It was so sudden. The last time we were together we were cuddling and laughing.

I have a lot of love to give, faithfulness, and affection. I've already been asked out twice but It's too soon and I don't know how to function yet. I can't eat the food I ate when I was with him, watch the shows, listen to the same music. 

I lost the future that I thought I had with him. I wanted it so bad and now it's gone.

My major also requires a lot of outside of class work. This would leave very little time to talk and come up on the weekends for visits.

 -We have a summer fling. -When I asked my mom for advice she suggested this. According to her, going on a date will help take away some of my social anxiety around dating and make me more confident for future dates with other people.

Then the clothes started coming off, and I don't know why, but she was just a lot heavier than I thought under the clothes. I don't know if she was much bigger than I thought, but her bodyfat ratio was high, and she didn't wear the fat well.

I am very attracted to her when she's clothed, but I have to admit I became less attracted after she got naked. I hate that I even have to say it because our chemistry is so perfect, and she has a very pretty face even.

So now I'm in conflict. I am thinking I want to hang out with her at least one more time to see if I can get over this, but I don't want to lead her on. I hate that my superficial prejudices could screw up an amazing connection like this. What should I do?
TL;DR: ", How could you find a way to reconcile your feelings about her physical appearance with the amazing connection you have?,"It can be challenging to reconcile your feelings about someone's physical appearance with the strong emotional connection you have. However, it is important to remember that physical attraction is just one aspect of a relationship. It might be helpful to focus on the qualities and characteristics that you love about your partner, rather than solely focusing on their physical appearance. Additionally, open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings can help both of you understand each other better and find ways to address any concerns or insecurities. It is also worth considering seeking professional guidance, such as couples therapy, to navigate these complex emotions and find a way to strengthen your relationship.","It can be challenging to reconcile your feelings about someone's physical appearance with the strong emotional connection you have.

TITLE: Wanting to go to an out of area school for 6 months. How would you pull it off?
POST: I'm wanting to go to a very prestigious furniture making and design school. The best part is is that it is ran by a community college so the fees will not be insane. 
This school would be an investment for my side business in woodworking.

My question though is that I have a full-time job in healthcare. I've talked to my manager and I would not have to quit my job. I could go on Per Diem and show up to work from 2 days every 2 months to stay on payroll and retain my job. 

The school is about a three hour drive (James Krenov school of fine wood working in Fort Bragg, CA) 
And we would work 5 or 6 days a week for 10 hour days. It's very intense. 

I rent a house and make a payment on my truck. The car is paid off. 
I'd like to keep the house because I have a full sized shop detached from the house with all of my woodworking equipment and tools. 
So either I could find someone to take my room for 6 months and pay the rent or eat the bill myself (700/month) 

My greatest concern about doing this is that I would not have an income for 6 months and would probably have to find a room or apartment to go to school in the area. 

I have a gf who is a RN and said she would help me with bills and finances til I was finished but I really don't want to do that. 

I'm not sure I would qualify for student loans either aside from private loans because I fear my income might be too high, though I haven't looked.

TITLE: What are some good motorcycles for a beginner?
POST: Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting my M1 - just passed the safety course and waiting for my paperwork to take the written test at the DMV.

That being said, I'm pumped up to buy my first bike and start endangering you all on the road. Which leads me to the pickle I'm in - I don't really know very much about motorcycles and what would be a good first bike. I've done the standard Google searches on ""best first bike"" and I learned on a 2008 Honda Nighthawk, so I suppose I'm leaning that direction.

What I do know is this, I want either a standard or cruiser-type bike around 250cc (maybe a little higher). I'm not looking for a sport-bike or something that's going to race, I just want to get from Point A to Point B without breaking my neck, but also looking kinda cool (i.e. NOT A SCOOTER). I've got about $2,000 to spend on the bike since there's a good chance I'll screw it up during the learning process. Any ideas or bikes you want to sell me?

Thanks!

It offers a comfortable riding position and is suitable for getting from Point A to Point B without the need for high speeds. However, it is important to note that the Honda Nighthawk is a discontinued model, so finding parts and accessories may be more challenging compared to newer models.

When learning to ride a motorcycle, it is crucial to prioritize safety. Some safety precautions to consider include wearing appropriate protective gear such as a helmet, gloves, and sturdy footwear. It is also recommended to take a motorcycle safety course to learn the basics of riding and develop good riding habits. Additionally, practicing in a safe and controlled environment, such as an empty parking lot, can help build confidence and improve skills before venturing out onto the road.

With a budget of $2,000, there are several options available for beginner motorcycles. Some popular choices within this price range include the Honda Rebel 250, Kawasaki Ninja 250, and Yamaha V Star 250. These bikes offer a good balance of performance, reliability, and affordability for new riders. However, it is important to thoroughly research and inspect any used motorcycle before making a purchase to ensure it is in good condition and meets your specific needs.","The Honda Nighthawk is a popular choice for those looking for a standard or cruiser-type bike around 250cc.

It is also recommended to take a motorcycle safety course to learn the basics of riding and develop good riding habits. Additionally, practicing in a safe and controlled environment, such as an empty parking lot, can help build confidence and improve skills before venturing out onto the road.

With a budget of $2,000, there are several options available for beginner motorcycles. Some popular choices within this price range include the Honda Rebel 250, Kawasaki Ninja 250, and Yamaha V Star 250. These bikes offer a good balance of performance, reliability, and affordability for new riders. However, it is important to thoroughly research and inspect any used motorcycle before making a purchase to ensure it is in good condition and meets your specific needs.",0.98883945,1.0000002,1.0,1.0,llamaindex

POST: So I was seeing this girl a few months back and everything was going great. Then came the winter holidays and didn't really talk to her at all over the Christmas period and I sort of stopped fancying her.

TITLE: My girlfriend [25F] might get a job in another city and I [26M] am thinking to follow her
POST: Hello r/relationships,

I will try to be short. My girlfriend [25F] has an interview for a job in another city, let's called it C because it is the third city in our equation. I [26M] am from city A where I live but I work all week in city B. She is also from city B, and that's why have a common ground. (the distances are not big deal but the working schedule is hell).

Now she might get the job in city C and probably move there too. 

Obviously, I want to follow her. What is your opinion on that?

You see, to get any other job for me in any town is easy. But there are no opportunities for the field I work in any city. So it is hard to move but not impossible. 

The thing is that I don't want to lose her for anything. It will be a huge step to follow her, for both of us. We are together almost a year and she is everything for me (yeah I know, a cliche phrase but I never had anything before her. So now, I have everything).

Following her, basically means for me going to ground zero in my career  but also taking my life completely on my hands and exploring alternatives. 

Not following her, means losing her.

She knows that I am most likely to follow her but she won't demand it. 

Also, I have no one to ask these things...

TITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?
POST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).

My income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.  Budgeting as best we can for rent, car, phones, utilities, groceries, and other routine expenses come out to around $3,000/month.  It does not cover things like trips, car repair, and other incidental expenses.

We have around $10,000 in savings, but half of that is owed to my parents over the next few months (interest free loan to help us move to my new job location).

The issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  

Since we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  

We have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.  Our thoughts were to do this for the time being and then accelerate our payments once she returns to work.  Is this a good idea?

TITLE: My [21/M] girlfriend [21/F] constantly looks through my phone while I'm asleep. Time to end it?
POST: So my girlfriend and I have been getting along great our entire relationship. My family loves her, her family loves me, and we usually got along great.

However, she always goes through my phone while I am asleep at her house. It started before we were even official, and she woke me up at 5 in the morning crying about a text between me and a girl who I had grown up with. It was just a casual conversation between me and her, nothing that could be construed as flirtatious. 

Mind you, I've never even thought about cheating on her, the messages she freaks out and cries about are me and my friends who happen to be girls just talking. Nothing flirtatious at all. 

A year later, I can count 6 occasions where she has gone through my phone (and I've found out about it). I have caught her twice as I've come back from the bathroom, the other 4 times have been when I was asleep. When I tried putting a passcode on my phone, she asked why I did it and she accused me of trying to hide something. She was able to find out my password by looking over my shoulder one day, so I got rid of the password altogether. She has a password on her phone, but I have seen her type it in enough that I know what it is. Never have looked through it.

She has looked through my Snapchat history, Twitter favorites (""WHY WOULD YOU FAVORITE THAT GIRL'S TWEET!?!""), texts, Facebook messages, if you can think of it she's gone through it. 

I used to think it wasn't that big of a deal and that it was ""normal"" (this is my first serious girlfriend ever) until I mentioned it to my guy friends, who immediately were taken aback and said how messed up it was. 

What do you think...I've already talked to her about it and she's said she will stop, but she **never does**. Is it time to end it?

TITLE: My [21/M] girlfriend [21/F] constantly looks through my phone while I'm asleep. Time to end it?
POST: So my girlfriend and I have been getting along great our entire relationship. My family loves her, her family loves me, and we usually got along great.

However, she always goes through my phone while I am asleep at her house. It started before we were even official, and she woke me up at 5 in the morning crying about a text between me and a girl who I had grown up with. It was just a casual conversation between me and her, nothing that could be construed as flirtatious. 

Mind you, I've never even thought about cheating on her, the messages she freaks out and cries about are me and my friends who happen to be girls just talking. Nothing flirtatious at all. 

A year later, I can count 6 occasions where she has gone through my phone (and I've found out about it). I have caught her twice as I've come back from the bathroom, the other 4 times have been when I was asleep. When I tried putting a passcode on my phone, she asked why I did it and she accused me of trying to hide something. She was able to find out my password by looking over my shoulder one day, so I got rid of the password altogether. She has a password on her phone, but I have seen her type it in enough that I know what it is. Never have looked through it.

She has looked through my Snapchat history, Twitter favorites (""WHY WOULD YOU FAVORITE THAT GIRL'S TWEET!?!""), texts, Facebook messages, if you can think of it she's gone through it. 

I used to think it wasn't that big of a deal and that it was ""normal"" (this is my first serious girlfriend ever) until I mentioned it to my guy friends, who immediately were taken aback and said how messed up it was. 

What do you think...I've already talked to her about it and she's said she will stop, but she **never does**. Is it time to end it?

TITLE: I [17 M] don't know how to start a relationship with a girl [16 F]
POST: Well, a little context first, I've been in love/attracted plenty of times over my life, but never I've been able to be with a girl. I've been rejecter every time.

This time the girl (let's call her Caterine) I have a crush on appeared in my life 6 months ago. I met her or a classical concert I went with some of my friend, she was a close friend of one of them so we chat a little bit. I was instantly attracted to her.

2 Months later and 3 more concerts I managed to grow a pair large enough to invite her to a date (as friends, I didn't imply that I liked her that moment) so we could learn more about her.

I was charmed even more by her, she was funny, intellectual, cute, we had a lot in common, same vision of the world, same sense of humour, etc. 

We saw each other 2 or 3 more times and we started chatting over the internet, well I've been using the internet for a long time so I'm pretty nerdy in some aspects so I tried not to show that part of me to her, as it turns out she is as nerdy as me. 

We could talk about everything, from philosophy to things worthy of being in /b/ (just not that fucked up). 

So I like her. A lot. But like always I took my long ass time in knowing her so I'm kinda friendzoned now. Things are starting to look like all previous times. I have for a given that if I express my feeling towards her now I'll be rejected. 

I'm fed up of being rejected.

I don't know what to do. How do I start a relationship with her?, if I do nothing she could met another guy and start dating him.. (it has happen to me before and it's horrendous). I don't want to be a friend anymore.

Thank you for reading.

TITLE: I feel like my dad is cheating me out of a large amount of money. What do?
POST: I'm currently 17. I lived with my dad my entire life. My mom died in 2009 and I began receiving social security checks every month for about $600. In November (2010) part of our house burnt down and we got an insurance check for around $20,000. 

Now, my dad is not a poor guy. He makes about $30 an hour full time, and has a girlfriend who works full time as well. However, he always tells me how ""broke"" he is, and how he can't afford anything. I think this is complete bull shit. He shops at the expensive grocery store, always eats out, and buys himself expensive toys like motorcycles. And he is not in any debt. 

A few months ago I began to ask him about the social security check and the insurance money. He told me that he was able to take care of me financially (as in buying food, health insurance, etc.), but the only thing he can't afford is my car insurance. So basically, he's saying that the only part of my social security check that is being used on me is for car insurance. So where the hell is the rest of the $600 going? He doesn't even pay for my phone bill, gas, or clothes. This I have to pay for myself, even though I have no income. Actually, he did buy me a HALF tank of gas once. But his girlfriend told him not to do that anymore. I feel like she's in on this too. 

 As for the insurance money, we got the check in about January and I have not seen a cent of it. I believe I lost about $700 worth of stuff in the fire, and only one thing has been replaced. He agreed to buy me a new computer instead of giving me money, which I agreed to.  NOW, he's saying I need to give him $300 and then he will buy me a computer. 

Then my cat got sick. The bill was around $600 and now he's saying that I need to pay him. (My cat is still living with him, unfortunately.)

Our relationship has been particularly rocky lately. But

POST: As usual this didn't happen today, it actually happened around 10 years ago when I was in grade 4 or 5.

I was not the most popular kid in school back in the day, probably starting from around grade 2 nobody liked me and my friends. It did suck being hated by so many, but things were a lot worse for the 2nd tier dorks. There was a few kids in my school that would wander the play ground alone and cause all girls to run away in fear if they ever got close. Seeing as I also got a similar, less disgusted reaction from everybody I felt bad for one of these kids. I started talking to him, joking with him, overall trying to cheer him up and this is were things went down hill.

It was a normal day in class, me and the weird kid said hello, talked a bit and then he insisted that he sat next to me. I didn't really mind and continued on with my work. I started noticing he kept staring at me without saying anything but I just ignored it, seeing as he was 'the weird kid'. A few minutes later, with the speed of 6 hyenas, he jumped forward and bit me on the arm. For about a second or two I sat there, completely bewildered as he nibbled on my arm. After realizing it was actually hurting a lot, I pushed him away and yanked my blood covered arm right out of his slimy gob. He looked at me and apologized as I turned and ran to the teacher.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my Girlfriend [16 F] (4 months) - I'm constantly paranoid i'm screwing up my relationship and it's having bad effects on me
POST: Let me preface this by saying I love my girlfriend very much, and most of this is probably my fault.

Alot of time whenever I'm talking to/skyping/etc with my girlfriend i'm worrying that i did something wrong and that she is weirded out or mad at me and just isn't telling me. It doesn't help that this is a long distance relationship so we rarely get to see each other in person (like every 2 months at best). 

This is likely entirely my fault, although it could be caused by what happened in a previous (semi-)relationship that I was in where the girl lied to me extensively and now I feel insecure and unable to trust any reaction my girlfriend has, even though I do love her with all of my heart.

This is having an effect on me as a person.. (I am finding it harder to focus, i'm often apparently more outwardly sad to people while i'm worrying about this stuff, etc. I don't know what to do at this point but I don't want to break up with my girlfriend because I know it's an issue with me and not her. What should I do?
TL;DR: ", What do you think caused your insecurity and lack of trust in relationships,"The experiences you had growing up with your abusive mother, including the verbal abuse, physical abuse, and constant manipulation, likely contributed to your insecurity and lack of trust in relationships.

TITLE: Me [18 M] with my Girlfriend [16 F] (4 months) - I'm constantly paranoid i'm screwing up my relationship and it's having bad effects on me
POST: Let me preface this by saying I love my girlfriend very much, and most of this is probably my fault.

Alot of time whenever I'm talking to/skyping/etc with my girlfriend i'm worrying that i did something wrong and that she is weirded out or mad at me and just isn't telling me. It doesn't help that this is a long distance relationship so we rarely get to see each other in person (like every 2 months at best). 

This is likely entirely my fault, although it could be caused by what happened in a previous (semi-)relationship that I was in where the girl lied to me extensively and now I feel insecure and unable to trust any reaction my girlfriend has, even though I do love her with all of my heart.

This is having an effect on me as a person.. (I am finding it harder to focus, i'm often apparently more outwardly sad to people while i'm worrying about this stuff, etc. I don't know what to do at this point but I don't want to break up with my girlfriend because I know it's an issue with me and not her. What should I do?
