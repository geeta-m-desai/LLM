I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun.

And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else.

Mary and I aren\'t particularly close, but we still talk quite a bit. She doesn\'t really take anything that seriously; she\'s always making a joke.\n\nIt was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn\'t realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I\'d realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn\'t have any classes left).\n\nI ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She\'s really fucked. Nah, don\'t worry about it, she\'ll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can\'t tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can\'t remember the rest of the conversation, so I don\'t really know what else was said.\n\nThe whole thing just seems so surreal, like a bad dream. Emma told me that I should try and forget about it, but I just can\'t stop thinking about it. I feel like I should do something, but like I said we\'re not particularly close and I don\'t think Mary would be comfortable talking openly about it with me. I want to be able to help, and I don\'t want her to feel uncomfortable around me because of this.

"['SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Is it a date? Or just as friends? M(18) F(17)\nPOST: So, I\'ve know this girl a while through other friends and she\'s been at gatherings I\'ve been to. The other day at a party I finally plucked up the courage to talk to her properly (not just the usual ""hi how are you"" stuff)  and we got on really well. \n\nThe only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn\'t sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don\'t go for dicks, because you\'ll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn\'t a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He\'s not a dick, he\'s my best friend"". \n\nNext day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I\'ve already seen it but it\'s so good I want to go twice). She said it\'s be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". \n\nThe thing is, I don\'t fully know whether it\'s an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don\'t really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do. But then again, there is still that guy who she wasn\'t sure whether she liked...will he just leave the equation instantly? So, basically, in your opinion, Reddit, is it a date?\nTL;DR:']", What did your friend say that made the girl you like question whether she liked the other guy,This is generic answer as relevant information could not be obtained.
