I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. \n\nHer perspective:\nIn my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. \n\nWe both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.\n\nThanks in advance! :)\nTL;DR:""]", How can couples effectively support each other when one partner has more knowledge in a certain subject?,"This is generic answer as relevant information could not be obtained.

"['SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend\'s [22M] Dad\'s side of the family.\nPOST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.\n\nLast summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he\'d been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We\'re planning a future together.\n\nHis mother\'s side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.\n\nWhile his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad\'s side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom\'s house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom\'s that night. \n\nAnd ever since then, they\'ve still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won\'t look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I\'m going to ""take him away"" and don\'t want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it\'s very uncomfortable to go over to their house.\n\nI just feel like an outcast, even though I\'m trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend\'s sake.\n\nI just don\'t know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?\nTL;DR:']", How can I show my boyfriend's Dad's side of the family that I am committed to my relationship with my boyfriend for the long term?,"This is generic answer as relevant information could not be obtained.

I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met.

It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together.

The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. \n\nMy older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.\n\n It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on.

"['SUBREDDIT: r/dating_advice\nTITLE: Is it a date? Or just as friends? M(18) F(17)\nPOST: So, I\'ve know this girl a while through other friends and she\'s been at gatherings I\'ve been to. The other day at a party I finally plucked up the courage to talk to her properly (not just the usual ""hi how are you"" stuff)  and we got on really well. \n\nThe only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn\'t sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don\'t go for dicks, because you\'ll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn\'t a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He\'s not a dick, he\'s my best friend"". \n\nNext day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I\'ve already seen it but it\'s so good I want to go twice). She said it\'s be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". \n\nThe thing is, I don\'t fully know whether it\'s an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don\'t really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do. But then again, there is still that guy who she wasn\'t sure whether she liked...will he just leave the equation instantly?

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?\nPOST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).\n\nMy income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.  Budgeting as best we can for rent, car, phones, utilities, groceries, and other routine expenses come out to around $3,000/month.  It does not cover things like trips, car repair, and other incidental expenses.\n\nWe have around $10,000 in savings, but half of that is owed to my parents over the next few months (interest free loan to help us move to my new job location).\n\nThe issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  \n\nSince we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  \n\nWe have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.

There's been ups and downs recently and in early February we broke up, but were still in contact with each other everyday. Earlier last month the GF left on a trip for two weeks. The day before she left we reconnected and It seemed like we were getting back together. We made a promise to not sleep with anyone and to talk more when she gets back. I send her some brief emails, she comes across really distant so I back off a little, not wanting to smother her. She gets back and we click, get along amazingly, it feels like a fresh start between us and I couldn't be happier. \n\nNow she tells me that she slept with some guy while on the trip. I'm angry, hurt etc. Today had a face to face talk where I forgave her but also said we shouldn't be together or talk anymore. She's a wreck right now to say the least, extremely remorseful.   \n\nI understand we weren't technically together, but she made a promise to me before she left. I do love her.

These parties were usually thrown by really rich kids with massive houses and tons of money to throw away and what was my favorite part was that since these kids were in a different school district we never really knew them or had to see them on a regular basis.\n\nSo we\'re at this party having a great time and what not but like I\'m prone to do I drink waaay to much and pass out. So I\'m laying on the sofa when suddenly its like Jesus himself brings me forth and is like ""Steve, you need to piss NOW"". So I jump up.\n\nY\'know when you need to piss but there is like this subconscious countdown that begins in your head? You\'re like ""I gotta pee...but I got like 5 minutes until systems go critical."" Well I just woke up from my beer-coma and systems were beyond critical. \n\nSo I start running towards my best guess where a bathroom might be but as this is a massive house I get a little lost.

I liked her and she liked me. I'd say there wasn't a very intense passion to the relationship, but there was definite affection towards each other. Both of us cared for each other deeply without question.\n\nYet I felt like something was missing. I wanted there to be passion in the relationship. I was always excited about seeing her and every so often tried my best to escalate things and take it to the bedroom, though she only was comfortable doing so a handful of times (fewer than five times) during the entire course of our relationship. She often made excuses about not wanting to get physical - either she was on her period (I had no issue with this), or she was PMSing or she said she hadn't taken her birth control. She often seemed to have a reason like that and obviously I didn't ever want to be pushy so I always felt compelled to drop it even though this frustrated me greatly.\n\nI feel guilty that something like this was such a sticking factor to me. Almost like it's supposed to be too trivial a reason, but to me it wasn't. I wanted more with her. And even told her about it. She just didn't seem to want anything to change. \n\nI broke up with her recently, telling her that there were some incompatibilities that I couldn't handle anymore but never actually saying what it was because it didn't seem to me like I needed to be that blunt about it. I haven't heard from her since, so I'm not sure how she's even taking this. But I feel horrible, partly because I know I probably hurt her feelings by breaking up so suddenly out of the blue and partly because my heart hurts from having to end things with a wonderful human being. \n\nI haven't reached out to her since then either. But this whole thing makes me sad. I'm usually the one on the receiving end of breakups and it actually sucks to be the one who initiated it. I feel guilty about it and it hurts.\n\nI don't necessarily have a question. I guess I just needed to talk about it.

Relationship of 2,5 years.\n\nWe are 2 outgoing people, we do alot of fun things, together or with friends, we respect eachothers boundaries, and do what we want to do.\n\nWhenever we're out, we tend to hit the bars, and drink. Whenever my girlfriend is out with her friends, she tends to be drunk.\n\nLast week, she had a busy agenda, going out 5 days out of 7. I had to work, the only time i heard her that week was her to tell me, how rought the party was (not mentioning drinks), or that it was very late in the morning, this is on monday, wednsday, thursday, friday, saturday, she doesn't work and only has to do her finals for this year. in my mind i start to think, damn, she's 5/7 drunk. Which is a negative quality, and i get frustrated, building up resentment untill i see her and then it explodes in her face. Telling her i don't love her anymore, think she's a marginal, cause she's always drunk, i want to end the relationship. I regret this now. (i should've told her before, instead of building it up, my bad)\n\nNow, i get the full blaim, she asks me or i don't trust her, she says she can't touch a drink anymore when i'm around, i need help to figure out what's causing the problem.\n\nI have a double feeling about this.\nTL;DR:""]"," What is causing your resentment towards your girlfriend?

It's not what it sounds like, he actually advised me to stay with him. And we became friends, not super close.. but yeah, closer.\n\nThen his birthday came around maybe like a month later and we both got drunk and he asked me to kiss him, we made out.. then he left and we didn't talk about it. The next weekend it happened again, but before it did I asked him why, he said because he liked me a lot. We left the club and went to watch a movie, we made out through it and he asked me if I thought I was ready for a relationship, I answered honestly and said no, plus we'd have to go back to our own countries soon, (3 months from now).\n\nWe went on a date then back to our countries for Christmas and that was it. But I was the one who suggested we meet.\n\nThe day before, it happened all over again, we went out got a little tipsy, and he started declaring his love. It was a little silly, but he kept insisting that the wasn't that drunk (I've seen him much worse) and that he just didn't know how to say this any other way. He asked me out. I was a little taken aback. I said we'd talk about it later.\nBut the next morning, nothing.\n\nI'm really sick of this cycle. We make out, then we ignore the subject.

I\'ve replaced the fuel pump, knock sensor (happening now), rotors, brakes, belts, rack and pinion, and the clutch now has about 107,000 miles on it and is starting to slip pretty bad. It is in the shop as we speak having the knock sensor replaced, and there is also a moaning/squeaking noise when I come out of first gear that I\'m sure will be another problem. I feel like the car is going to continue breaking down and unfortunately my warranty does not cover any of this since it is considered ""normal wear"" on the car. \n\nI think that money could have gone towards payments and I feel kind of dumb for even buying the car (still completely stock, but I wanted something faster than my Martix (idiot move)).

What can we do to help him?\nPOST: Here\'s how it happened: \n\nMy mother was scolding him for his mess and told him to do fold some towels. Before there are any suspicions, my mom wasn\'t scolding him in a demeaning or abusing way; she is just tired of telling him over and over again to pick up after himself. Next thing I hear, he is calling for me from our family room and tells me our sun conure is ""sick"". When I get to the birdcage I see that our bird is lying on the top of the cage, bleeding from his nose, and clearly struggling to breathe. I ask my brother what happened and he tells me the bird ""fell from his cage"". I call desperately for my mom and she tells me he is dying. The next two minutes are complete agony as I watch my bird, *who has been one of my best friends for the last 11 years*, die by suffocating on his blood.

Mainly because I didn\'t treat her like a girlfriend.

I didn\'t know how to react so I was just like ""ok"". But now she always says ""I love you"" before we go to sleep, or I leave or something. \n\nI never say it back because I still only kinda like her, I\'m no where close to feeling like I love her or being able to say it back to her, and honestly, I feel kinda bad about it.

The main problem at this point, is that even though there's enough room in bed for the 3 of us, my wife and I don't sleep as well because of partner disturbance, and having to be extra careful not to disturb our precious time bomb. I've ended up sleeping on a spare bed outside of the room.

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: How much to keep liquid for grad school?\nPOST: I am applying to grad school for fall 2016 and I want to make sure I am being as smart with my money as possible. \n\nRight now I currently have about $30k sitting in my savings account, (I know, I know, that's why I'm here asking!) about $7k in Vanguard index funds that I contribute ~$1000 to over the course of each year, and I just became eligible to get matching contributions to my 403(b) at my job. (They match 5% if I contribute 3% or more)\n\nI've wanted to keep a lot of my funds liquid because I'm not sure what the future will hold. Ideally I will get into a fully funded phd program and get a 25k/year or so stipend, but there is a chance I will do an in-state not-funded masters first. I still have enough in my college fund to cover the pretty inexpensive in-state tuition for 4 semesters, but I would either have to have enough savings to live on for 2 years, or take out loans. \n\nSo now the question is how much I should contribute to the 403(b).

Particularly before and after (i have a fair idea of what I should say during). I\'m unsure how to handle the ""before"" because I don\'t think she will have much warning I do t want it to be a surprise bit at the same time I feel our relationship should be indicative of itself but my friends and family have told me they don\'t think she will see it coming at all. The ""after"" I think is tricky because we met in university and she didn\'t have any close friends until I pulled her in to my group of friends, when I leave I believe they will all take my side and she\'ll have no one. I also don\'t know what to do in terms of no contact.\n\nI still care about her a great deal and want this to go as smooth as possible.\n\nIssues: (you can skip this if its unnecessary I know its getting lengthy)\n\nShe wants to get married and start a family asap... And I want to focus on my career and getting my life on track, I\'m not sure if we\'re even right together to be married. sometimes I think she\'s so set on getting married it blinds her to our relationship issues. As far as my career goes I plan to open my own engineering firm and this takes a lot of capital which I don\'t think could be feasible with the lifestyle she wants.\n\nShe is very argumentative, little things normally, I pick my battles but lately I haven\'t had the patience.\n\nOur sex drives are polar opposites, basically the passion has been gone for over a year now and she only does it to placate me...

One day she had a get together with me and to other girls and I brought a monster so I could stay up later. After I drunk most of it I put it in my friends mini fridge and forgot about it, the next morning her dad found it. (I wasn\'t there when he found it, so I don\'t know the exact reaction he had) My friend said that he literally interrogated her until she told him who had brought it. That was my first mistake, and apparently her parents weren\'t really that mad since I never even gave her a sip of it. But the next time I went over there I borrowed her iPad to go on reddit and accidentally forgot to log out. Her mom used it the next day and went through the account (not even knowing what Reddit was) and saw me using some not so ""appropriate"" words (no cussing AT ALL at her house, her parents are especially strict about that rule). She ""interrogated"" my friend again about who\'s account it was. Also, one of the things i posted was a rage comic about her from over the summer and her mom saw that too, so her mom was extremely POed about me talking about her like that (we had a HUUUUGE dissagrement over the summer, but we have become really good friends since then). I know what I did was wrong but now my friend\'s parents said that I\'m not allowed to hang out for a looooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnngggg time, and defiantly not until next year(they never said that to me, they said that to my friend)!

I\'d hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it\'s because I haven\'t been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven\'t been exercising as frequently as I\'ve gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I\'ve felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14!
