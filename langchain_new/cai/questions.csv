POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

TITLE: Me [19F] with my friend [19M] 10 months, Insecurities - Show or Tell?
POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!

TITLE: Prioritize student debt or saving for down payment?
POST: I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. 

Sometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. 

At the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment? I have $5200/mo to somehow split between debt and down payment and I'm not sure how best to allocate it.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.

TITLE: Me 28 F with guy I'm dating 30 M - 1 month, Is it okay to ask if everything is okay or am I being pushy?
POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

TITLE: Is it weird that this turned me off from my gf?
POST: The other day my girlfriend(23 years old) and myself(22 years old) were talking and she revealed to me that she almost didn't date me because I was too short (5'7""-5'8"").  She is only about 5'5"".  Now she loves me a lot and thinks I am the best thing to ever happen to her but for some reason, learning about this, really turned me off. I have never associated height with anything other than how tall is someone, but apparently people associate height with strength, power, attractiveness and other stuff that has nothing to do with height.  Is it bad of me to want to break up with her for this shallow view?

TITLE: I (27/F) am obnoxiously paranoid after a gynecological health scare. How do I explain my ridiculous hormonal-ness to my boyfriend (32/M)? (X-posted to /r/AskWomen)
POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.

When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.

It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?

TITLE: Me [20/F] having trouble with boyfriend [23/m] of 2.5 years sex drive
POST: My boyfriend and I have an amazing sex life. We are very sexually compatible.

Although, his sex drive is crazy high compared to mine. It really depends on the time of month for me [hormones], sometimes I'll be down to go 3 times a day and sometimes I'm only interested in once a week. 

I'm asking for advice because I have a hard time denying him without him feeling rejected by me. For example, every time we cuddle he is almost always coming on to me. At night he comes on to me, in the middle of the night he masturbates next to me, and tries to come onto me in the morning. I'm utterly flattered that after being in a relationship this long he is still very turned on by me, but sometimes it is very overwhelming to keep up with his sexual needs. 

I've been trying more to just give him a HJ or BJ if he is really frisky and I'm not, but sometimes I really am just emotionally drained from life and just want to be cuddled. I've explained this to him several times and he gets very frustrated and defensive and states he doesn't feel like I want to please him....which is not the case at all. I can see how sometimes he would feel this way because when he asks sometimes my ""tone"" may come across annoyed or uninterested. I don't want him to feel this way and it has been a problem for a while now. 
I want to learn how to approach his needs better without him feeling rejected, and I want us both to be happy.

POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. 

And I know my usual advise for someone in this situation would be to cut out the distraction entirely, but since we work together I can't. I usually tell my boyfriend everything, but this I don't want to, I don't want to hurt him, and in addition I'm afraid of building it up into something more than it is.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

POST: I (male, 19) met this girl at collge (19 too) a couple of months ago. At the moment I met her, nothing really special happened between us happened, we just chatted a bit and left as early friends.

Then, I entered college (the same where she studies) and we started to connect faster; we have a lot in common, we're both interested in culture and knowledge, and we often tend to play around and have a good time together.

Then I found out that a friend of mine (let's call him A) has liked her since before I knew her, about 8 months or so ago. She didn't liked him back, and supposedly they settled as friends. However, it seems that he is still trying something, and whenever I try to be playful with her he seems very uncomfortable about it.

Also, I've been supsecting that she likes another friend of mine; but I'm not certain of that.

TITLE: [HELP] Not sure how to deal with new people/dogs and my big ole pup
POST: I have a three year old Dober/Pit mix named Romulus (""Rome"" for short). He's about 105lbs and for the most part a good guy. I live with 3 other dogs: a 10 year old labrador, a 2 year old French Bulldog and a 8 year old maltese mix. The four of them get along just fine, Rome and the Frenchie are best best best best friends.

 

He isn't the best at meeting new people, but not ALWAYS. Sometimes he gets skittish, circles with his tail between his legs. Other times he happily brings the new person a toy and wags and is generally adorable. I've found that if I'm around and make a big happy ""look at your new friend! Now go find a present! What a good present and what a good dog!"" noise he gets happy and excited. We've been having massive construction on our house for the last 7 months and now he's best friends with all of the workers, walks around the yard helping them, and they've learned all of his commands from me (sit, down, wait, paw, other paw, and touch- a favorite). 

 

Dogs are a little trickier. I have a big yard and people are always wanting to come over for doggie playdates. I don't know if on-leash is the best way to first introduce, or let the new dog into the yard first and then bring my dog (his name is Rome) in on a leash, or meet in the street or what. There is always a little getting-to-know-you period and then play (if sometimes a little intense). If the new dog stays too long, a fight usually breaks out. He never starts the fight but he always stops it. He's not seriously hurt anyone, yet. But I feel like its just around the corner

 

Then, the crux of the matter: I want to have a 4th of July party. Several people want to bring their dogs. I doubt I can say ""no dogs allowed"" and I don't want to let everyone else bring their dog and make mine stay at day care all day.

TITLE: I [16 M] think one of my friends [17 F] is self-harming. What should I do?
POST: I was talking to two of my friends at school yesterday - we'll call them Mary and Emma. Emma is a good friend of mine and one of Mary's best friends. Mary and I aren't particularly close, but we still talk quite a bit. She doesn't really take anything that seriously; she's always making a joke.

It was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn't realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I'd realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn't have any classes left).

I ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She's really fucked. Nah, don't worry about it, she'll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can't tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can't remember the rest of the conversation, so I don't really know what else was said.

The whole thing just seems so surreal, like a bad dream. Emma told me that I should try and forget about it, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I should do something, but like I said we're not particularly close and I don't think Mary would be comfortable talking openly about it with me. I want to be able to help, and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable around me because of this. I just feel so helpless.

We met 6 years ago, FWB off and on for about 3 years. We live (now) in different states.

I broke things off 2 weeks ago though because I couldn't ignore weird vibes anymore. Finally googled his name and city and got clear proof he's been married for 2 years. I was out of the country at the time of his marriage and we were not in contact.

TITLE: Has anyone ever gone batshit crazy before, and how did you patch your life back after that?
POST: *First time posting on Reddit. Been lurking for awhile and thought this a much merry place to be.*

For context, I have been suffering from depression for the last few years. And as a reaction to depression, I did get pretty angry for awhile, and lashed out at people close to me. I'll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. 

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

Anyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.

Plus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.

But I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me.

I've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. 

My question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.

POST: *First time posting on Reddit. Been lurking for awhile and thought this a much merry place to be.*

For context, I have been suffering from depression for the last few years. And as a reaction to depression, I did get pretty angry for awhile, and lashed out at people close to me. I'll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. 

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

TITLE: Contacting my biological father, who doesnt know I exist because of falsified DNA test [Washington]
POST: I'm going to try to keep this short so it doesn't drag long into a soap opera.

When my Mom [22 F at the time] got pregnant with her boyfriend at the time [24 M], aka my Dad, she decided he would be the right fit for many reasons. He ended up harassing her by constantly calling her work/showing up at her house. My mom ended up getting a retraining order.

Fast forward to when I was born, my Dad wanted to get custody over me which my mom did not want. I ended up being sent to a different country as a baby during the whole trial. When the court asked for the DNA test, not sure how they did this, my mom used a different kid for the test? So it ended up being in court that he is not my father.

Now growing up I didn't know anything about the DNA testing, but I knew about the harassment and being sent to a different country. (I was sent back to my mom around the age of 1 once the case was done). My mom was honest in terms of that her and my Dad didn't work but I could meet him when I turned 18. She said it couldn't be before then or else he might try to get custody over me. Once I turned 18 she ended up telling me about the whole DNA thing, and how she feels horrible but is asking me to not meet my Dad as he might press charges against her if he found out that what she did was illegal.

Now currently I'm 19 and am 100% sure I found the other side of my family through investigation. But now am unsure how I should even approach him? My mom has been abroad for the past 2 years and my relationship with her has gone down the drain, for other serious reasons.

In the end I'm just kind of lost at what I should do as I want to meet my Dad I never knew. And my whole life we've lived in the same town. And he lives only 10 minutes from my place. What should I do? Thoughts and opinions?

TITLE: I [19M] have been talking to/seeing [18F] friend for about 3 months and have no idea what I'm doing.
POST: So basically I met a girl in the beginning of the semester during our orientation week.  She caught my eye the first day and we ended up talking on a bus ride somewhere and clicked.  We exchanged numbers and continued talking.  

Fast forward a weekend and I actually start texting her (during orientation week we were in the same group so saw each other everyday) and have quite a long conversation.  We continue texting and I eventually ask her to hangout (eat) which she agrees to.  We go to an ice cream shop and me being a dumbass forget to pay for her, but she didn't seem to mind.  We talk for a good 3 hours, losing track of time, and then I dropped her off back at her dorm and there was that.

I text her at least once a week and we have lunch together at least once a week for the last six weeks.   

We have different majors so the only time I see her is when she is walking to her class (small school) and our weekly lunch. Though I ask her if she wants to do something almost every weekend but since she is a is a D1 athlete so she doesn't really have a lot of time on the weekends due to that and homework. Either way I still ask just because.

Overall, I really like her and I feel that through our conversations she does the same. I've been told that because of our lunch deals and me taking her out twice we're basically together, but I want to know for sure.  

Oh and I haven't been in a relationship or had a thing with someone before and she doesn't know this.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

TITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend's [22M] Dad's side of the family.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

I just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?

TITLE: I [28 F] just confronted my Borderline mother [54 F] about all the things she has done to ruin my life up until now...
POST: I had been advised by my psychologist not to contact her due to the negative effect she was having on my personal life and mental health (I myself have problems with mental illness). But she had been relentlessly trying to contact me after I cut off contact without giving her a reason. 

So today I emailed her detailing everything she had done including the emotional neglect and abuse of myself and other family members and of her interfering and trying to end the relationship between myself and my husband on numerous occasions, and of ignoring my mental illness and making me suffer it out for years as a child, plus multiple other things I can go into if requested.

The thing is now I can't help but feel guilty despite everyone patting me on the back and me knowing it was needed for closure. She has conditioned me to feel extreme guilt if I go against her wishes etc.

As many people with Borderline parents know, the parents sometimes don't realise they have a problem despite the diagnosis of a mental illness (she thinks it's everyone else who is crazy, not her). So I know she will deny everything I have told her, yet she will play the victim as usual and somehow it will get back to me and I will again feel terribly guilty.

Anyway I am just wondering if anyone has experience with borderline parents or other relationships and how they coped with the guilt of confronting the person, or how they coped at all with the stress of the situation. I'm in a rush so I'm sorry if I've left heaps out, I'm new to reddit as well so getting used to the layout, but I can add more details if requested.

TITLE: [Update] I [17 M] am crazy about this this girl [17 F] and need advice on how to proceed.
POST: My previous post can be seen here: 

We have remained in touch since I originally posted this. She has since broken up with this guy [17/18 M] from Alberta, apparently due to what I understand is the relationship being somewhat abusive in nature. We met again on Friday and I thoroughly enjoyed the encounter of ours. I'm kinda crossing over into r/depression territory here, but I think that one of the reasons that we've seemed to bond is that we are both suffering from varying degrees of depression.

Before I reconnected with her in September (after previously having met her earlier in the year) my depression was reaching what I consider to be an all time high. I felt like I was completely alone and had to fake any happiness that I presented to my friends. I made a lengthy post on FB basically ranting about this and she messaged me a short time later. She told me that I didn't have to worry and that I could always come to her for help/advice. I thought that this was awesome, especially considering that nobody had really showed me this sort of of attention prior to my post.

This would eventually lead to the meeting/date at Tim Horton's which I mentioned in my previous post. It was there that we had an open discussion about both of our depressions. It had a great time and she was the first person that I was able to talk to in detail about this. Our second meeting on Friday was just as good, if not better, than the first. We had more open discussions about various things that we were going through/had gone through.

I thought my situation was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to what she had gone through. I won't go into detail but suffice to say she gained a lot more of my respect that day. I can also honestly say that me being with her was the first time that I felt legitimately happy in such a long while. I'm really looking forward to us meeting again.

So now that this other guy from Alberta is out of the picture I'm wondering what exactly I should do. I would like to ask her out for a formal date but I'm not sure how long I should wait considering she was just in a relationship.

At first I did not really see this as anything long term, but gradually I have started to appreciate every little thing about her.

But now I suddenly find myself in this relationship that I can see potentially lasting forever. 

I think about this a lot, for example after after a recent conversation where she was telling me about some of the awkward dates she had in the past, because I know 
that it also helped her figure out what she wants and to realize that I'm the right one for her. A part of me wants the same experience. I am afraid that I will always be looking back and regretting not to have tried anything else. 

Confession: While writing this, I finally had to admit to myself the biggest reason for my hesitation. It was difficult to face it, but I have to be honest. If my girlfriend was perfect there would be no problem, but in the looks department, she is a 5, while I am a 9. I don't want more dating experience just to make sure that my current girlfriend is perfect for me, but also to convince myself that a ""traditionally"" prettier girl would not make me any happier. Because the fact is that I know that my girlfriend would make me happy, and that I can make her happy. 

I know that I can't just tell her that I love her, but that I need a few months on my own to find out what I want... 

Are there any solutions to this problem? I realize the obvious answer is ""you just don't want to be with her, end this"", but that simply isn't true.

POST: We've been together a few months now and things are going swell. We're some 150 miles apart (she works, I'm in grad school). We see each other every or every other weekend depending on how busy we are and it's good so far.

One small hiccup: our presence on social media. By nature I'm a pretty private person and keep a small group of friends. I only share relevant stuff with my close friends and I am not prone to advertise my life, I think its a bit frivolous. Yes I have a Facebook, Twitter, and IG but I use that to keep a tab on what's going on in the world but just so I'm aware and in the loop. 

She's a bit of the opposite.

We've recently become followers of each other on Instagram (IG is shorter for my convenience) and we both have browsed through each other's IG's to look at old pics as I'm sure everyone does. Little comments here and there, the usual.

BUT this is where my problem begins. I have some family/friends on IG but as I said, not everyone I care to advertise my relationship(s) to in general because it's called a personal life. Some of her comments are pretty G/PG but quite a number are saucy and flirtatious (PG13/R). I'd rather she not post such things on my IG but I don' t know how to tell her without sounding like an asshole. I've begun to field questions from people I don't care enough to share about my personal life and it's kinda annoying to be honest.

He hasn't texted me a lot recently.  I have to text him first or he won't text me all day.  This has been going on for a week now.

Recently I've stopped texting first just to see how long it takes him to text me.  He usually starts texting me around 7 pm to 9 pm.  

I understand work and life can get in the way, but he used to text me every morning when he woke up.  He's not cheating and I'm sure of that, he's a good guy.

POST: We first met about a year ago - no common friends of any kind - and first went out this April. I got really loose on the first date and may or may not have said that i'm not looking for anything serious. We went out on brunch and other stuff afterwards and sex just happened along the way. i have been going out on dates since then with other people but never went so far as sex. 

Until very recently, we see each other on average once a month and sometimes we just hang out. I have never slept over at his place before last night (i am a light sleeper and the idea of sleepover stressed me out) although he stayed at mine 2 out of the last three times he came over. 

Another thing is frequency, he came over ""prepared"" (brushed his teeth, packed suit for next day) this thursday after i booty texted him while drunk. Then he wanted to see me on friday, which i turned down and on saturday again - to which i responded and went to stay at his place because my heater is broken. 

We never define what it is, fuck buddies or fwb. Now that sleepover seems more regular, i don't know if it's time to bring up the question. If so, how should i communicate this? As far as myself is concerned, I am willing to go down the casual dating route and be perfectly happy about it.

TITLE: Me [23 F], my SO [24 M] of a year, I want to break up but I have no place to go.
POST: So I have been dating my boyfriend over a year. Let's call him Austin. I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met. I worked through a terrible depression which has been persistent for the past few years. I isolated myself so now I am friendless, jobless and have no transportation. I am trying to put my life back together and after long reflection, I have realized Austin and I are two very different people. There is a general lack of communication and respect for the other person. So here is my dilemma: Do I  break up with Austin?

 I am a very open, honest person. It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together. I have an older sister across the country but we have not talked in years. The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. 

My older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.

 It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on. But I also took a vow never to subject myself to my parents abuse again. I am open to any other ideas/suggestions/solutions.

The only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn't sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn't a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He's not a dick, he's my best friend"". 

Next day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". 

The thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do.

TITLE: Is it a date? Or just as friends? M(18) F(17)
POST: So, I've know this girl a while through other friends and she's been at gatherings I've been to. The other day at a party I finally plucked up the courage to talk to her properly (not just the usual ""hi how are you"" stuff)  and we got on really well. 

The only problem was she then started talking to her friend about how she isn't sure if she likes this guy. She said he was a bit of a dick. My friend (also her best friend), being a boss of a wingwoman, told her ""don't go for dicks, because you'll just end up getting hurt"". So the girl I like asked ""But who isn't a dick?"" and my friend pointed at me and said ""He's not a dick, he's my best friend"". 

Next day I decided to talk to her over facebook and ask if she wanted to see a film which she said she really wanted to see. (I've already seen it but it's so good I want to go twice). She said it's be ""really nice"" and we organised a day. I asked her about getting something to eat before and she said we could just ""go and have a coffee"". 

The thing is, I don't fully know whether it's an actual date, or just as friends. We both really love the film, so it could just be that, but we don't really know each other well enough for it to be something friends would do. But then again, there is still that guy who she wasn't sure whether she liked...will he just leave the equation instantly? So, basically, in your opinion, Reddit, is it a date?

POST: The future was so bright, we were going to live together. We never fought. I tried so hard to make him happy. We talked through everything, I always admitted when I was wrong and we seemed so good at fixing problems. I couldn't make him happy. He was depressed, but in a way that he hid from me. I didn't mind when he was sad I tried to comfort him. 

It was never perfect but we were so close and now I feel so lonely. He said he used to love me but doesn't now. Then he changed his mind, said he could love me, and when he saw me again he said he couldn't. He said he saw me like a sister. I got furious with him, yelled at him, I cried, I bawled my eyes out. 

It was so sudden. The last time we were together we were cuddling and laughing.

I have a lot of love to give, faithfulness, and affection. I've already been asked out twice but It's too soon and I don't know how to function yet. I can't eat the food I ate when I was with him, watch the shows, listen to the same music. 

I lost the future that I thought I had with him. I wanted it so bad and now it's gone. 

I want to be able to sleep. I want to connect to other people who's hearts are hurting like mine, so I know I'm not alone.

POST: Hi all!

Backstory: I just recently came out of my ""ugly duckling with extreme social anxiety"" phase I have never had a boyfriend/girlfriend (am also a ""supervirgin"") or many friends.I have really come out of my shell these past few months!

I [19f] have started a new summer job and will be transferring to a university that 4 hours away. I will be quiting exactly a month from now. I met this [21m] guy at my job. He's great and we are both interested in each other. Next time I see him at work will be Saturday and his close friend told me that he is planning to ask me out. I have never had a crush like this before and this is also the first guy who is interested in me in a non-sexual context. My only issue is that he isn't in school and therefore lives permanently up by our job. I am moving into an apartment by my university and will be living down there until I graduate in 3 years (I will be an entering sophmore). I see myself as having 3 options:

 -We date and do it long distance -However, I am worried that I will be a bad girlfriend. My current class schedule is hectic and I still have to work to pay for my apartment. My major also requires a lot of outside of class work. This would leave very little time to talk and come up on the weekends for visits.

 -We have a summer fling. -When I asked my mom for advice she suggested this. According to her, going on a date will help take away some of my social anxiety around dating and make me more confident for future dates with other people.

-I stop everything in its tracks now.

I'm not sure what to do. And would really appreciate anyone's advice.

TITLE: I [27 M] met an amazing girl [29 F], but my superficial prejudices could screw it up.
POST: I went on an online date with an amazing girl. She's smart, funny, and we just had chemistry. I've been on many online dates, and the awkward silence during certain bits of the date is just par for the course. This date was different. We always had something to talk about, and more over we were on the same page. We'd even say the same thing at the same time - it was surreal.

This girl is also beautiful. She was a bit heavier than her pictures, but this is something I've come to expect from online dating, and I didn't really mind.

Date 2 was great too. More of that awesome chemistry, more of that great conversation. Then the clothes started coming off, and I don't know why, but she was just a lot heavier than I thought under the clothes. I don't know if she was much bigger than I thought, but her bodyfat ratio was high, and she didn't wear the fat well.

I am very attracted to her when she's clothed, but I have to admit I became less attracted after she got naked. I hate that I even have to say it because our chemistry is so perfect, and she has a very pretty face even.

So now I'm in conflict. I am thinking I want to hang out with her at least one more time to see if I can get over this, but I don't want to lead her on. I hate that my superficial prejudices could screw up an amazing connection like this. What should I do?

POST: Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting my M1 - just passed the safety course and waiting for my paperwork to take the written test at the DMV.

That being said, I'm pumped up to buy my first bike and start endangering you all on the road. Which leads me to the pickle I'm in - I don't really know very much about motorcycles and what would be a good first bike. I've done the standard Google searches on ""best first bike"" and I learned on a 2008 Honda Nighthawk, so I suppose I'm leaning that direction.

What I do know is this, I want either a standard or cruiser-type bike around 250cc (maybe a little higher). I'm not looking for a sport-bike or something that's going to race, I just want to get from Point A to Point B without breaking my neck, but also looking kinda cool (i.e. NOT A SCOOTER). I've got about $2,000 to spend on the bike since there's a good chance I'll screw it up during the learning process. Any ideas or bikes you want to sell me?

Thanks!

POST: So I was seeing this girl a few months back and everything was going great. Then came the winter holidays and didn't really talk to her at all over the Christmas period and I sort of stopped fancying her. Was thinking of calling it off but thought it'd be a bit harsh given the time and didn't want it to be awkward for the NYE party we were both going to, which we ended up together at by the end of the night anyway. Since then, we haven't texted or messaged one another, sort of mutually although I feel like the ball was in my side of the court. Fine, worked out well in the end. Forgot about her. 

Have been very busy with work so not much time to do anything anyway but saw her today and it brought back a whole host of feelings and I'm not sure how to play it. Definitely would like to rekindle the flame but a) I don't know how she'll react, don't want to come off as using her as we run in similar circles and I don't want to embarrass her and b) I'm worried I'll do the exact same thing and suddenly stop fancying her.

TITLE: My girlfriend [25F] might get a job in another city and I [26M] am thinking to follow her
POST: Hello r/relationships,

I will try to be short. My girlfriend [25F] has an interview for a job in another city, let's called it C because it is the third city in our equation. I [26M] am from city A where I live but I work all week in city B. She is also from city B, and that's why have a common ground. (the distances are not big deal but the working schedule is hell).

Now she might get the job in city C and probably move there too. 

Obviously, I want to follow her. What is your opinion on that?

You see, to get any other job for me in any town is easy. But there are no opportunities for the field I work in any city. So it is hard to move but not impossible. 

The thing is that I don't want to lose her for anything. It will be a huge step to follow her, for both of us. We are together almost a year and she is everything for me (yeah I know, a cliche phrase but I never had anything before her. So now, I have everything).

Following her, basically means for me going to ground zero in my career  but also taking my life completely on my hands and exploring alternatives. 

Not following her, means losing her.

She knows that I am most likely to follow her but she won't demand it. 

Also, I have no one to ask these things...

Thanks everyone in advance for the time you spend on this post!

TITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?
POST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).

My income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.  Budgeting as best we can for rent, car, phones, utilities, groceries, and other routine expenses come out to around $3,000/month.  It does not cover things like trips, car repair, and other incidental expenses.

We have around $10,000 in savings, but half of that is owed to my parents over the next few months (interest free loan to help us move to my new job location).

The issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  

Since we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  

We have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.  Our thoughts were to do this for the time being and then accelerate our payments once she returns to work.  Is this a good idea?

It was just a casual conversation between me and her, nothing that could be construed as flirtatious. 

Mind you, I've never even thought about cheating on her, the messages she freaks out and cries about are me and my friends who happen to be girls just talking. Nothing flirtatious at all.

I have caught her twice as I've come back from the bathroom, the other 4 times have been when I was asleep.

POST: Well, a little context first, I've been in love/attracted plenty of times over my life, but never I've been able to be with a girl. I've been rejecter every time.

This time the girl (let's call her Caterine) I have a crush on appeared in my life 6 months ago. I met her or a classical concert I went with some of my friend, she was a close friend of one of them so we chat a little bit. I was instantly attracted to her.

2 Months later and 3 more concerts I managed to grow a pair large enough to invite her to a date (as friends, I didn't imply that I liked her that moment) so we could learn more about her.

I was charmed even more by her, she was funny, intellectual, cute, we had a lot in common, same vision of the world, same sense of humour, etc. 

We saw each other 2 or 3 more times and we started chatting over the internet, well I've been using the internet for a long time so I'm pretty nerdy in some aspects so I tried not to show that part of me to her, as it turns out she is as nerdy as me. 

We could talk about everything, from philosophy to things worthy of being in /b/ (just not that fucked up). 

So I like her. A lot. But like always I took my long ass time in knowing her so I'm kinda friendzoned now. Things are starting to look like all previous times. I have for a given that if I express my feeling towards her now I'll be rejected. 

I'm fed up of being rejected.

I don't know what to do. How do I start a relationship with her?, if I do nothing she could met another guy and start dating him.. (it has happen to me before and it's horrendous). I don't want to be a friend anymore.

TITLE: I feel like my dad is cheating me out of a large amount of money. What do?
POST: I'm currently 17. I lived with my dad my entire life. My mom died in 2009 and I began receiving social security checks every month for about $600. In November (2010) part of our house burnt down and we got an insurance check for around $20,000. 

Now, my dad is not a poor guy. He makes about $30 an hour full time, and has a girlfriend who works full time as well. However, he always tells me how ""broke"" he is, and how he can't afford anything. I think this is complete bull shit. He shops at the expensive grocery store, always eats out, and buys himself expensive toys like motorcycles. And he is not in any debt. 

A few months ago I began to ask him about the social security check and the insurance money. He told me that he was able to take care of me financially (as in buying food, health insurance, etc.), but the only thing he can't afford is my car insurance. So basically, he's saying that the only part of my social security check that is being used on me is for car insurance. So where the hell is the rest of the $600 going? He doesn't even pay for my phone bill, gas, or clothes. This I have to pay for myself, even though I have no income. Actually, he did buy me a HALF tank of gas once. But his girlfriend told him not to do that anymore. I feel like she's in on this too. 

 As for the insurance money, we got the check in about January and I have not seen a cent of it. I believe I lost about $700 worth of stuff in the fire, and only one thing has been replaced. He agreed to buy me a new computer instead of giving me money, which I agreed to.  NOW, he's saying I need to give him $300 and then he will buy me a computer. 

Then my cat got sick. The bill was around $600 and now he's saying that I need to pay him. (My cat is still living with him, unfortunately.)

POST: So far in my college career I have taken all of my humanities courses on the subject of music (they tend to interest me more than others). There are always research topics that we are allowed to choose. During my first semester, I did it on a band I pulled out of a hat (seriously, I just hit shuffle on iTunes and picked a topic concerning that band).

POST: So, I just got a lovely little cat named Luna. She's about a year, a year and a half and pretty tiny. I live in an apartment located on the 5th floor of my building. My apartment doesn't have AC (I'm in NYC) and I usually like to leave the windows open for ventilation. They've got child bars, but because Luna is so small she can easily fit through them--and did a few moments ago. Nearly gave me a heart attack watching her slip through them and walked out onto a very narrow ledge 5 floors above a concrete sidewalk. She came right back in, but now I'm concerned about having a dead cat on my hands (or more accurately, on my sidewalk). So my question is, should I trust her cat instincts and leave the windows open?

TITLE: TIFU By befriending a cannibal in grade 4-5.
POST: As usual this didn't happen today, it actually happened around 10 years ago when I was in grade 4 or 5.

I was not the most popular kid in school back in the day, probably starting from around grade 2 nobody liked me and my friends. It did suck being hated by so many, but things were a lot worse for the 2nd tier dorks. There was a few kids in my school that would wander the play ground alone and cause all girls to run away in fear if they ever got close. Seeing as I also got a similar, less disgusted reaction from everybody I felt bad for one of these kids. I started talking to him, joking with him, overall trying to cheer him up and this is were things went down hill.

It was a normal day in class, me and the weird kid said hello, talked a bit and then he insisted that he sat next to me. I didn't really mind and continued on with my work. I started noticing he kept staring at me without saying anything but I just ignored it, seeing as he was 'the weird kid'. A few minutes later, with the speed of 6 hyenas, he jumped forward and bit me on the arm. For about a second or two I sat there, completely bewildered as he nibbled on my arm. After realizing it was actually hurting a lot, I pushed him away and yanked my blood covered arm right out of his slimy gob. He looked at me and apologized as I turned and ran to the teacher. When the teacher asked the kid why he savagely barraged my arm with nibbles, he just straight up said ""I was hungry"".

POST: Let me preface this by saying I love my girlfriend very much, and most of this is probably my fault.

Alot of time whenever I'm talking to/skyping/etc with my girlfriend i'm worrying that i did something wrong and that she is weirded out or mad at me and just isn't telling me. It doesn't help that this is a long distance relationship so we rarely get to see each other in person (like every 2 months at best). 

This is likely entirely my fault, although it could be caused by what happened in a previous (semi-)relationship that I was in where the girl lied to me extensively and now I feel insecure and unable to trust any reaction my girlfriend has, even though I do love her with all of my heart.

This is having an effect on me as a person.. (I am finding it harder to focus, i'm often apparently more outwardly sad to people while i'm worrying about this stuff, etc. I don't know what to do at this point but I don't want to break up with my girlfriend because I know it's an issue with me and not her.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 3 years. There's been ups and downs recently and in early February we broke up, but were still in contact with each other everyday. Earlier last month the GF left on a trip for two weeks. The day before she left we reconnected and It seemed like we were getting back together. We made a promise to not sleep with anyone and to talk more when she gets back. I send her some brief emails, she comes across really distant so I back off a little, not wanting to smother her. She gets back and we click, get along amazingly, it feels like a fresh start between us and I couldn't be happier. 

Now she tells me that she slept with some guy while on the trip. I'm angry, hurt etc. Today had a face to face talk where I forgave her but also said we shouldn't be together or talk anymore. She's a wreck right now to say the least, extremely remorseful.   

I understand we weren't technically together, but she made a promise to me before she left. I do love her. I want to forgive and forget, but the images and fact of it happening keep eating away at any thought of her I have.

Yet, for some reason, he still brings up ""when we have our own kids!"", ""when you're pregnant, and I have to rush you to emerge"", or ""I can't wait until I get to create a little life.""

And every time, I have to remind him that it's not really possible and he gets really sad. We have talked about adoption, but I don't know if he is that interested in adopting. 

I just wish I could be that pregnant girlfriend or wife he wants in the future, but at the same time I wish he could be sensitive to the fact that I can't and wont have kids.

TITLE: I [24 M] ended a very new relationship with a long time friend [24 F] because we seemed to want different things out of our relationship. She seemed to agree when I brought it up to her, but now I am not sure if I did the right thing.
POST: So I had met this girl when I started this new job. She worked there for a few months after I got hired, then moved onto a different career path. But was still a part of the social circle I was a part of. I had a huge crush on her soon after, she did not reciprocate that feeling. I was a little sour about it, but decided to remain cordial to her as she was still in my immediate social circle. 

Fast forward a few years, we had each gone off and dated other people, but also grew to become close friends through out this time. Then about two months ago, after a few drinks together, she out of the blue kisses me, thus spawns our relationship. 

As you can see, I had some mixed feelings about this, as i don't really appreciate being the ""ace up some ones sleeve"". But I chose to pursue this because I had to at least try.  Things are fine for a few weeks, we dated pretty casually, saw each other once or twice a week at most. Then she started to grow distant, like she didn't ever have any time to see me etc. After it had been almost three weeks since I had seen her or even had a meaningful conversation with her I confronted her about it. After arguing via text message for a few days, I understood that she just wanted a much more casual relationship than what I had wanted. I told her that this relationship wasn't going to make either of us happy since we want different things out of it. She agreed and we both decided to remain friends, as there wasn't any animosity towards each other. 

I felt it was a necessary decision at the time, but after a few days have passed, I feel like I may have done the wrong thing for the right reasons, and that I have thrown away a chance to be in a decent relationship with some one I enjoy.

Our relationship for the most part has been pretty good. We get along well in nearly every capacity - life plans, sex, etc. I'm very happy with him.

Yesterday he asked me to move in with him. I'm graduating college this fall, and am looking for a job in the same area he works.

When he asked, I realized... I really don't want to live with him. And I feel my reasons are kind of stupid.

I'm very close to my family, and I feel living with him would impede my ability to see them often. I travel to go see them and I don't want him to come with me. It's not that they don't like him - quite the opposite. I just don't like having him there. I have to entertain him, and he takes away from my ability to be with them. 

Also, I want to move in my parents someday. I know he's against moving in his or my parents in the future, but I wish to live with mine. 

Finally, I really enjoy being alone. I don't enjoy having him at my apartment longer than a few days - I begin to crave being fully alone.

I really do love him. But I don't know if this is a sign of a bigger issue or not. What should I say to him? Do you guys think this means anything?

POST: So my GF is my first sexual partner, my GF has had many.

She talks to guys from her past. She talks weekly to 2 exes, which I'm fine with, but we recently got into a big fight, because she was texting, snapchatting and calling another guy who was either a fuck buddy, or used her for sex, or something along those lines, from her past. She yelled at me ""I WILL TALK TO WHO I WANT TO TALK TO!!!!!! YOU DONT DESERVE TO KNOW MY PAST!!""

Initially, she was mad that I called her out on him being suspicious and her being secretive about this person. They talked infrequently for 2 months while in our relationship, and she kept her history with them and that they were talking at all, a secret. I told her I don't care if she has a past, I just don't like it when the past comes back around. I found out they were talking by seeing her best friends on Snapchat. She's always been one to delete all the texts her in phone.

Recently, I've been in these group chats with old elementary school friends, mostly the same 2-3 girls, and they just talk about some of the sketchy people from our class and where the heck they made it off to. We party together in the summer, but they've never been more than friends.

Anyways, now my GF is pissed that I'm talking to one good looking female friend, from elementary school, she says she's a slut and has ulterior motives. I would stop talking to her, but I think I first need to make it clear that my gf said she is going to talk to who she wants to, yet she's trying to control who I talk to.

There are always guys from her past, buzzing around our relationship, putting me down because I'm younger, etc. She has a lot of sexual partners, and they seem to come back around. I have none, so every girl I talk to, has only ever been just a friend.

TITLE: Alright Reddit, What is the worst/craziest thing you've ever done at a party?
POST: I only think it is fair I should begin.

So growing up in a small town everybody knows everybody but once in awhile we got a rare chance to go to these massive house parties out in the country. These parties were usually thrown by really rich kids with massive houses and tons of money to throw away and what was my favorite part was that since these kids were in a different school district we never really knew them or had to see them on a regular basis.

So we're at this party having a great time and what not but like I'm prone to do I drink waaay to much and pass out. So I'm laying on the sofa when suddenly its like Jesus himself brings me forth and is like ""Steve, you need to piss NOW"". So I jump up.

Y'know when you need to piss but there is like this subconscious countdown that begins in your head? You're like ""I gotta pee...but I got like 5 minutes until systems go critical."" Well I just woke up from my beer-coma and systems were beyond critical. 

So I start running towards my best guess where a bathroom might be but as this is a massive house I get a little lost. I run into a dark room and think ""Fuck it. I'm not peeing myself."" So I whip down my pants and start peeing.

I hear this weird hissing noise but I'm too busy feeling relieved to care so once I'm done I zip up and walk away.

A few minutes later people are saying they can smell something really rank, kinda like piss. I can smell it too.

So this smell is permeating throughout the house and everyone is talking about it trying to find the source. Finally this girls who's throwing the party Dad comes down and starts investigating.

He comes back a few minutes later red as a child's freshly spanked bottom and screams ""WHO PISSED ON THE FURNACE!?""

I've never ran so fast in my life.

Been seeing this girl, let's call her Stacey, for about a month or so. She's attractive, great personality, respectful job etc. Things have been good so far, however, we've had sex 10 times so far and every time I've gone down on her for 20 minutes at a time (I have no problem with this as I find it a turn on too) she obviously likes it, but then it just turns into sex. She hasn't gone down on me once yet, which I respect but I'm wondering what's putting her off? I know for some people that's not their thing etc but how should I go about talking to her about it respectfully?

POST: Me and my boyfriend have been friends for four years and dating for a year, the past year has been one of the best years of my life. We don't fight we communicate wonderfully and everything has been great. We talk about our future a lot and can honestly see ourselves getting married once we are out of school in two+ years. 

This fall I am moving for school and we will be a few hours apart and I will be without a car and will be working, he is also in school and has a job. We both know that because of school, the distance, and the difference in our schedules that we will not be able to see each other often, we have decided that we are willing to try. However, I am scared that the distance will turn what we have sour, and i'm not sure if we should risk what we have becoming ugly, i'm wondering if we should end it to preserve the wonderful times we have had. We have discussed separating because we both I think realize that it is probably the most logical thing to do but neither of us want to. 

My questions for you reddit is have any of you gone through a similar situation and if so how did you and your SO cope?

POST: Short backstory: I've known him for about 4.5 years, he got divorced last year, we've been seeing each other for about two months. As long as I've known him I've never seen him smoke. It's not a secret that I absolutely hate the habit (cigarettes). I just think it's disgusting and I personally don't (usually) date guys that smoke. I just prefer not to be grossed out by a guy I'm dating. 

I went to his place this past Saturday and saw a pack of cigarettes and I asked him about it, and he said that he has occasionally had one when he gets drunk, but rarely, and that he meant to throw the pack out. 

Last night we went out to the bar and after a little while he asked if I minded if he went to make a phone call he forgot to make earlier. When he came back inside, I thought I caught a whiff of it, and he sat a little further away from me than usually for ~20 minutes or so. Looked like he may have had a pack in his pocket, but I didn't see it so I can't be sure. That was the one and only time I've suspected it.

Since the fling ended my wife and I have been communicating so much better and we are in a good place again. This would fuck it all up. 

The girl I had the fling with didn't seem like she was going to have an abortion. She doesn't know I'm married so maybe it changes after that. I guess I would like to not be the father or there not to be a baby. My question is what should my move be? What do I need to be doing right now?

I'm 25/m and this girl is 20/f. My wife is 22/f.
TL;DR: ", How do I handle the conversation with my wife about this potential situation?

We work in different departments and see each other pretty regularly but theres always customers or coworkers around. I've known her for about 2 months. Is it okay to ask her if she wants to see a movie or something in front of coworkers? Id really rather nobody else be around but its so rare that were alone and so brief. I thought about passing her a note but that seems childish and kinda cheesy. I wouldnt mind asking her out in front of coworkers if I knew she was going to say yes but if she said no or she's busy in front of coworkers Id feel embarrassed.

POST: Heyooo,

So, I met this guy online on a non-dating website 6 months ago. We started talking every day, we've video chatted a few times, and we've exchanged literally thousands of messages to each other. It was gradual at first and in the beginning of our online friendship he said that I was easy to talk to because of the distance between us. I am in the US and he is in the UK.

Now, I'm preparing a trip to see him in two-ish months. He was hinting at it and I went right out with it and told him that I could come and visit him. He said he'd love it if I did.

I'm starting to get feelings for this guy. I get excited when I get messages from him. I get butterflies. It's weird because we've never met before but we've been talking pretty much every single day for 6 months.

I don't know if it's a mutual feeling or not. Could it be completely platonic if we've been talking every single day for 6 months and we've agreed on me leaving to the uk to meet him? Do you think there could be something more there or no?

Most of the messages are friendly type but he has given me a few compliments and stuff like that. I just don't know how to tell if there might be feelings on his end too because I've never communicated to this level with someone online that I've never met. I don't know how to tell or if there are any signs that there might be more there and we're just not saying it.

TITLE: I [28 M] suspect my Wife [29 F] of 2 years may be cheating. Need advice.
POST: My wife and I have been growing apart lately (lack of intimacy for about 3 months) and I've noticed a couple strange things that I want some unbiased opinions on.

 She goes to the gym 5 days a week for a couple hours. One day recently when she was leaving she said goodbye and then I heard her phone start giving her GPS directions. Why would she need directions to the gym she's been going to for a year? Is it reasonable to believe she had accidentally hit 'go' to somewhere else she was looking up earlier?

The other day in the car I saw an obvious text conversation open and asked (in a friendly way, not accusatory) who she was talking to. She quickly moved her phone and said she was browsing amazon. Multiple other times I've seen her quickly hide her phone or laptop as I've looked over. I've gotten a clear look a couple of times and it was absolutely a text message program.  

Mistrust is probably the quickest killer of a relationship and I haven't acted on any of this. I understand the severity of me even suspecting this. All of these could be innocent coincidences but together they've got me concerned.

How I see it I've got a couple of options:

A) Do nothing and let this either go away or eventually explode.

B) Ask her about it directly. I've asked her about the texts in the moment and she's lied, so I'm not sure if this would work.

C) Try getting access to her phone and see if there are any incriminating texts. This one would be risky and would absolutely damage our marriage if she found out. I really, really don't want to fuck this marriage up because of my paranoia.

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my ex [25 F] broke up and I feel guilty and sad since I initiated it
POST: We had been dating for about six months and things were going reasonably well. I liked her and she liked me. I'd say there wasn't a very intense passion to the relationship, but there was definite affection towards each other. Both of us cared for each other deeply without question.

Yet I felt like something was missing. I wanted there to be passion in the relationship. I was always excited about seeing her and every so often tried my best to escalate things and take it to the bedroom, though she only was comfortable doing so a handful of times (fewer than five times) during the entire course of our relationship. She often made excuses about not wanting to get physical - either she was on her period (I had no issue with this), or she was PMSing or she said she hadn't taken her birth control. She often seemed to have a reason like that and obviously I didn't ever want to be pushy so I always felt compelled to drop it even though this frustrated me greatly.

I feel guilty that something like this was such a sticking factor to me. Almost like it's supposed to be too trivial a reason, but to me it wasn't. I wanted more with her. And even told her about it. She just didn't seem to want anything to change. 

I broke up with her recently, telling her that there were some incompatibilities that I couldn't handle anymore but never actually saying what it was because it didn't seem to me like I needed to be that blunt about it. I haven't heard from her since, so I'm not sure how she's even taking this. But I feel horrible, partly because I know I probably hurt her feelings by breaking up so suddenly out of the blue and partly because my heart hurts from having to end things with a wonderful human being. 

I haven't reached out to her since then either. But this whole thing makes me sad. I'm usually the one on the receiving end of breakups and it actually sucks to be the one who initiated it. I feel guilty about it and it hurts.

I don't necessarily have a question. I guess I just needed to talk about it. If anyone has any words of advice or wisdom, I'm all ears.

I've asked why they got back together, and she said because he deserved a second chance, so I told her I didn't want to see her go through this break-up again (last time, it was quite emotional) and she said she would ""deal with it"". 
She's being very calloused when talking, and just kinda abrasive when we're not talking face to face (ex. texting). Last time, the guy pretty much cheated on her and called her bitchy. I've been nothing but good to her, and yet she still chooses this guy over me. I know, I sound like an egotistical jerk, but I'm really confused right now.

POST: This is a fight we had 2 times before, it's hard on our relationship, and if she doesn't get an explenation that it isn't going to happen anymore it's the end. Relationship of 2,5 years.

We are 2 outgoing people, we do alot of fun things, together or with friends, we respect eachothers boundaries, and do what we want to do.

Whenever we're out, we tend to hit the bars, and drink. Whenever my girlfriend is out with her friends, she tends to be drunk.

Last week, she had a busy agenda, going out 5 days out of 7. I had to work, the only time i heard her that week was her to tell me, how rought the party was (not mentioning drinks), or that it was very late in the morning, this is on monday, wednsday, thursday, friday, saturday, she doesn't work and only has to do her finals for this year. in my mind i start to think, damn, she's 5/7 drunk. Which is a negative quality, and i get frustrated, building up resentment untill i see her and then it explodes in her face. Telling her i don't love her anymore, think she's a marginal, cause she's always drunk, i want to end the relationship. I regret this now. (i should've told her before, instead of building it up, my bad)

Now, i get the full blaim, she asks me or i don't trust her, she says she can't touch a drink anymore when i'm around, i need help to figure out what's causing the problem.

I have a double feeling about this.

I know his feelings are there, he is just scared and even more importantly, scared of 'hurting' his family. I know I rambled but I just lost what was potentially the love of my life to cowardness. I guess all I'm asking is for advice, I know I can get over this, I'm just scared because I don't want too. We have gone down this road so many times, the problem is this time its for real.

TITLE: Why do I [23f], who has an amazing family and loving friends with a good life, hate myself? And how can I get past it?
POST: So this is me... I have a loving and amazing family. I have many loving friends. I have a great social life. It is easy for me to get the guy I want. I've just recently started talking to a really great guy, who really cares about me and likes me. So everythings cool and gravy and dandy so why do I not like myself so much???

I have wondered if it might be because I have been hurt a lot by guys I've dated/talked to. My dad left me when I was 8. I feel as though every man will leave me. (Trying to convince myself that this current guy wont hurt me, but can't really believe it). 

Recently after a very devastating breakup, for months I could feel nothing but hate for myself. What's wrong with me that he would leave and never speak to me again? I'm a good person. What part of me could they have hated so much to just throw me aside like I was nothing? It killed me. To clarify, this is not the reason why I started feeling like I didn't like myself. This feeling has been around for years. It is just after this breakup did I feel at my lowest, most terrible low. 

So sometimes when I am alone I will sit and want to cry because I don't like myself. And when I try to figure out why, I hate myself more because I truly can't find a reason. I know I'm not a bad person. I've never done anything to hurt anyone. I enjoy making others happy. I've never told any of my friends or family how I feel because they would have no idea either. They would tell me that I shouldn't feel like that. And I know I shouldn't but I can't help it and it is a terrible feeling. So i thought I would post here to see if anyone could relate/help out?

TITLE: TIFU by scaring the shit out of my friends
POST: So this happened just today. We're in highschool and me and my three friends (lets call them Bob, Steven and Tong) were eating lunch and chilling. We were making fun of Bob as we usually do and then Tong brings up the topic of the Charlie, Charlie pencil game (if you don't know what it is then go on youtube). We all tried it except for Bob and the pencil didn't move. So we all persuaded Bob to join in and I had this amazing thought. What if I just scared the shit out of my friends. 

Now, Tong and Bob were paranoid from this game for some weird reason and get scared easily. So when Bob said Charlie, Charlie come play with me, I decided to quietly blow the pencil to 'Yes'. Tong started screaming and ran so fast around the corner. Bob was probably scared as crap because it only worked for him, and Steven and I are just laughing our asses off.

Me and my friends calmed down and we all started trying it for ourselves. Steven, Tong and I tried it and I blew it to 'No' all 3 times. Then Bob tried it again and i blew it to 'Yes'. 

My friends were scared shitless. I would be surprised if Tong comes to school tommorow.

**They believe that if it says 'Yes', you have to hide from the paper for three hours or Charlie will find you (I'm not even joking)

POST: Now I make mistakes sometimes. Usually fine detail mistakes, like a typo in an important place. Or not knowing that someone put training equipment on a truck and I dispatch it on a job. I would say I could tack up one good mistake per month working.

I just came out of a meeting where I was told that mistakes were not acceptable in my position. It was intimidating because I know I will continue to make them.

I have worked the job I have for eight months, sort of. I was in logistics for 7 months. Then got moved to sales as a supervisor in January, which are really two totally different careers. But not to my GM. He asserted that after 8 months I should have all the mistakes out of my system.

Other than that I do very well. My sales are great. My customer service is top rated. I solved or diffused any number of problems daily in logistics. Of course, the one you miss is the one that gets noted, but that's just how it works.

Fact: I'm not detail oriented. I have to write everything down. My mind naturally moves to big picture questions and goes into auto-pilot fog when it's looking at data or double checking numbers. Sometimes I just straight up forget things.

So what is a reasonable expectation for an employee? Is human error okay? Does it just happen? Does my fight to focus on details mean I can't do detailed jobs to meet career standards? I've been guilty before of believing I really suck at life after things people told me, and had some therapy for it. So I really want to know what a fair standard or ""norm"" is that I can abide by.

Expect is a strong word here, but I would expect this would be a landlord-tenant style relationship in the sense that I would cover all household expenses related to home maintenance. Plumbing, electrical, roofing, appliances ... If anything breaks, then that's on me. With regards to bills we both contribute to (water, electricity, internet, etc), I'd expect to split those down the middle. With regards to the monthly payment, I'd also expect to split that down the middle. The reason for that is that it's a reasonable amount that's about equivalent to his current apartment rent. If we were to find a place to rent together, the expectation would be that we'd split a rent payment 50/50. I see the house as a shared space so I think it's reasonable that we share the expense of the house.

POST: Some background: Me and my boyfriend have been in a long distance relationship for almost a year. We attend different schools 5 hours apart. It was rough in the beginning because of the distance, but everything is great now. We text throughout the day and talk on the phone/skype every night. We see each other anywhere from every two weeks to once a month. We love each other very much. We are both graduating in May and plan on moving to the same city this summer.

To the heart of the matter: He only has 6 tickets for his graduation. I told him I understand if he wants to bring his family. But I can't help but feel hurt that I don't ""take precendence"" over some of the family members he isnt close with. He doesn't come from the most stable families, and has been on his own pretty much since he was 18. Idk why family members he doesn't even really talk to get a ticket while me, his girlfriend, arguably the one person most involved in his everyday life, doesn't get invited. 

In fact, he hasn't even explicitly said he wants me come down there graduation weekend. Every time I bring it up, he says he doesn't know what the plans are. He hasnt told me not to come though. If the tables were turned, he would be the first person I would want at my graduation. Am I wrong for being hurt about not getting a ticket?
TL;DR: ", Is there another way to celebrate your boyfriend's graduation besides attending the ceremony?

TITLE: My boyfriend (age 22) of 5 months can't handle how many sexual partners I (female - age 23) have had.
POST: I've been with 29 other people, and he brings it up almost every day. I've also had a threesome, which he talks about constantly. He feels like he can't please me sexually (even though I always tell him that isn't so. He is one of the only people I've been to orgasm with, and it's the best sex I've ever had) because I've had so many partners who HE thinks I liked more than him. 

We have long discussions on this topic (which turn into arguments) at least once a week. It's so frustrating. He constantly wants to look at my facebook messages because he thinks I must be cheating on him. He doesn't believe that I can want to be in a relationship after sleeping with so many people. I'm not sure how I can get this through his head or if it's even possible. This hasn't just started either; it's been going on basically since the beginning of the relationship. 

I'm just not sure what to do. The relationship would be perfect if it weren't for his jealousy and insecurity. I am just not sure if these things can be changed. When we're not talking about this stuff, we have a good relationship. These conversations make me SO angry though! He always threatens to break up with me, says I'm not showing him enough attention in public (wtf?), says that we don't have enough sex (twice a day isn't enough?), says that I don't do enough for him...and then he starts talking about the past again and all the people I slept with. He wants me to delete pictures of past exes on facebook because he doesn't want to see me having fun with other guys. What the hell?

There are just so many red flags, and I KNOW this. I know I should probably break up with him. It makes me mad even typing all this stuff out. I guess I just needed to vent, really.... I haven't told anyone else about this because I don't have many friends.

TITLE: Me [22 M] and my best friend [22F] got into a relationship - I need help
POST: We have been best friends since high school, we talked about everything and everybody and always had a good time together. She was the perfect ""best friend"", someone who would stay with you, the rest of your life. And then we got even closer. She fell in love with me, I couldnt hurt her so we started to evolve into a couple. The relationship has been official for a few months now, but we have been acting like a couple for over a year. I fear any advice might be too late.

The thing is: I like her, but I want to be single ( - doesn't really have to make sense to you, as long as it makes sense to me) 
I am old enough to know, that if I would break up with her I will lose her and our lives will seperate, but I really want her to be a part of mine.
I regret that I was too weak to say ""no"" to her, for our friendships sake.
But I know she is perfect for me, would be the perfect wife, but I am not ready for this. I now wish I would have met her in a few years, when I would actually be looking for that special someone.

I don't know what to do right now. I am happy when I'm with her, but I feel that there will be an end to the relationship (maybe in a few months, maybe in a few years, who knows).
Is there any possible way I wont lose her as soon as this is over? Can we somehow manage to stay friends? Does anybody have any experience or advice for me?

POST: I asked about this before but didnt really get any help :/ My boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me last weekend, and now he's spreading rumors about me around school. He's saying that I'm psycho/crazy and a bunch of stuff. What happened that led to the breakup is that some girl was texting him saying flirty stuff, he wasn't flirting back but she wasn't being appropriate at all and she knew he had a girlfriend.

I read some of these texts, I didn't go through his phone or anything. He left it in his room when he was in another and he got a text and I was going to bring it to him but it was from a girl so I just checked it. I didnt respond but I texted her from my phone and asked who she was and why she's texting my boyfriend and she told my boyfriend that i read their conversation and texted her.

Then he asked me about it and I just said I was worried and he said I'm overprotective and crazy and stuff and I got really upset with him and he broke up with me. I want to try to stay together but he pretty much hates me now, and he still talks to this girl, i saw in his twitter messages thing and I don't want them to end up dating or something.

POST: I'm an exchange student in a foreign country and in the group of exchanges there is this guy, he's cute but I didn't really notice him until he helped me out with when I was breaking up with my boyfriend. It's not what it sounds like, he actually advised me to stay with him. And we became friends, not super close.. but yeah, closer.

Then his birthday came around maybe like a month later and we both got drunk and he asked me to kiss him, we made out.. then he left and we didn't talk about it. The next weekend it happened again, but before it did I asked him why, he said because he liked me a lot. We left the club and went to watch a movie, we made out through it and he asked me if I thought I was ready for a relationship, I answered honestly and said no, plus we'd have to go back to our own countries soon, (3 months from now).

We went on a date then back to our countries for Christmas and that was it. But I was the one who suggested we meet.

The day before, it happened all over again, we went out got a little tipsy, and he started declaring his love. It was a little silly, but he kept insisting that the wasn't that drunk (I've seen him much worse) and that he just didn't know how to say this any other way. He asked me out. I was a little taken aback. I said we'd talk about it later.
But the next morning, nothing.

I'm really sick of this cycle. We make out, then we ignore the subject. I want to believe everything he says and believe him that he's using the alcohol as a means to express his feelings. But the sensible part of me doubts it. So I asked him if we could meet up to talk about it as it was silly that we haven't ever talked about it, and he agreed.

My question is, am I silly in asking him to talk about it? Should I just leave it and have some self control around him?

I enjoy speaking to nice people and am a genuinely kind person myself) and I asked, ""what?"" He said ""lemme get a magazine"" and, mind you, they're also directly in front of his face.

Ultimately, he asked if we had any samples and I said ""NOPE, nothing good"" which was a lie because we just received a whole shit ton. Fuck that guy. Why can't people just be nice? It makes everyone's day better.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my Ex/Notex/Whateverthefuckishappening [17 F] met yesterday the first time after the breakup
POST: Hey guys!

i have a problem.

PROLOG:

about Three weeks ago my girlfriend with which i had a 11 month relationship broke up with me because she will move away,and cause of her psychological Problems and because she dont know why.
she was for about 3 month in a mental hospital until last week  because she has depression and now she will move for 3 month in a Hospital in 2 other cities here in Germany and after that for 3 Month to Iceland
2 days ago i decided to have sex again with an other girl and it was really bad (physical and emotionally)

THE MEETING FROM YESTERDAY

we didnt contact each other since the breakup and she wrote me 

via Facebook that she wants to meet me to discuss everything

so we met in my home and discussed a bit and she found out that i had sex with someone else because i had a teared open condom package and there where cigarette fags with red lipstick in my ashtray(i wanted to tell it her later,but whatever) after that she telled me that she also had sex a week before with a friend of her. Then i was jealous and she was also jealous but tried to act like she is not jealous (she confessed it later)

We talked about our future and she meant that she dont know but she cannot be without me and that she cant be in a relationship with me.

After that we spend the day with cuddling,having Sex and watching The X-Files and she said the whole day long that she missed this

THE PROBLEM

Now i dont have any clue how i should react to it and i could think about our future or how i could heal my jealousy, it seems that she cannot be in a relationship with me,but she also cannot be not in a relationship with me.
TL;DR: "," What steps can I take to move past my jealousy and heal from the breakup? 
2. What reasons does my ex have for not wanting to be in a relationship with me"

POST: Hi everyone,

I bought my first non-Craigslist car, a 2005 Honda Civic SI with 79,000 miles on it, from a Honda dealer back in February 2013 for $10,000 + taxes, fees, a shitty warranty that I wish I did not purchase, etc. Everything came out to around $15,000. I put $5,000 down and financed the other $10,000 over the course of 5 years at a 10.9% interest rate. My monthly payment is around $240. 

Prior to this I owned a 2003 Toyota Matrix XR which I paid cash for an owned. I should have kept this. 

My Civic so far, over the past year, has cost me almost $2,500 in repairs. I've replaced the fuel pump, knock sensor (happening now), rotors, brakes, belts, rack and pinion, and the clutch now has about 107,000 miles on it and is starting to slip pretty bad. It is in the shop as we speak having the knock sensor replaced, and there is also a moaning/squeaking noise when I come out of first gear that I'm sure will be another problem. I feel like the car is going to continue breaking down and unfortunately my warranty does not cover any of this since it is considered ""normal wear"" on the car. 

I think that money could have gone towards payments and I feel kind of dumb for even buying the car (still completely stock, but I wanted something faster than my Martix (idiot move)). My question comes to this. Should I trade it in for something newer (I have pretty good credit of about 750) or pay off the remaining $7,500 I have left and then own the car while I continue to pay for repairs?

TITLE: What's your best example of beginner's luck?
POST: Could be your own beginner's luck, or beginner's luck from someone else at your expense.

For me, it was about 2 months ago. I was invited to play some poker with a friend and some of his other buddies.  Up until that point, I'd never played a single hand of poker in my life but knew the hierarchy of hands and that was about it.

I turned up late and missed the beginning of the game and they'd replaced me with someone else, but I stuck around to hang out.  To be honest, I was pretty pleased I wouldn't have to lose any money anyway.  Eventually, as people started dropping out, a side game started while the big game went on in the next room. It was a $10 buy-in and I started playing poker for the first time in my life.

I came away with a $37 profit an hour or so later.  I think the fact I wasn't experience enough to figure out strategy actually helped me.  The others didn't know my style and I didn't know theirs (or mine).  I made some dumb mistakes and I got really lucky on some hands, but I just used common sense and tried to weigh up my options as best I could and it worked out.  I haven't played since but I'm positive it won't turn out like that next time!

TITLE: 21/F UPDATE. I confronted his fiancé.
POST: Link to original post. 

First, I just wanted to say thank you to all that replied and sent me personal messages regarding this issue of mine. You all gave me the courage I needed to message her.

After I made the original post I gave him one more opportunity to come clean to his fiancée. I confronted him and told him that the games had to stop. Either he told her or I did. He responded that I was bluffing, a bitch, and she wouldn't believe me.

So I sent her the screenshots of our conversations, and my phone number. I told her to call me if she had any questions regarding what I sent her.

The evidence was on my side, 90% of our recent conversation were filled with ""Are you sure you don't have a fiancée?"" and him denying it and calling her *crazy*, *obsessed*, and that she needed to *let go*. 

I took a huge risk giving her my number. But the news I gave her needed to be discussed over the phone or in person. She called me an hour later. I expected her to be angry with me, possibly cuss me out. Call me a whore perhaps but she didn't. She cried for a long time and when she was able to speak she thanked me.

We talked for awhile about their relationship and about how she caught him talking to another girl in the past but let that one slide for the sake of her childern. This apparently was the icing on the cake. She added me on Facebook and when she broke up with him she went on Facebook and wrote about how she almost made the biggest mistake of her life. She personally tagged me and thanked me again that status. Felt a little weird about that but I rolled with it.

It wasn't two hours after that status was posted his messaged me and called me a stupid cunt. I was delusional and he never liked me. I ruined his relationship.. A load of bullshit. I sent her those messages and we laughed about it.

We may have met through weird circumstances but I may have made a new friend.

I don't regret telling her one bit, she seems like a wonderful person and she didn't deserve what he was doing to her.

TITLE: TIFU by pissing on my friend at an EDM festival [NSFW-ish]
POST: This wasn't today but ill post about it anyways. Last saturday, I was at this EDM festival called Waterzonic with a few mates. I was having a great time, there was water splashing everywhere, I was drinking the whole night and getting high in the parking lot. By around 10 pm I was piss drunk, I was hooking up with this cute girl, seems like a great night so far. Then my drunk brain thought it would be funny to piss on my friend. So I unzipped by shorts and whipped out my donger and started pissing on my friend a little. He got a bit pissed and started punching me in return. I was trying to block his punches cos he was drunk and was punching pretty hard. After he stopped, I was complaining about the punches and shit then I went back to raving and grinding with the girl I was hooking up with. The thing is that I forgot to put my donger back in my shorts so he was raving with me. All my mates were laughing, the girl I was with turned around and laughed too but I was too drunk to care and continued for a while until 10-15 minutes later this stranger came up with me and pointed at my donger. I shoved it back in whilst everyone was still laughing. Again I was too drunk to give a fuck so I just raved on. The girl was cool with it and stayed with me still. But the thing is that my donger was flying and raving with me when probably everyone around saw it.
TL;DR: ", How did the stranger know that your donger was out

TITLE: My 13 year old brother killed our bird out of anger. What can we do to help him?
POST: Here's how it happened: 

My mother was scolding him for his mess and told him to do fold some towels. Before there are any suspicions, my mom wasn't scolding him in a demeaning or abusing way; she is just tired of telling him over and over again to pick up after himself. Next thing I hear, he is calling for me from our family room and tells me our sun conure is ""sick"". When I get to the birdcage I see that our bird is lying on the top of the cage, bleeding from his nose, and clearly struggling to breathe. I ask my brother what happened and he tells me the bird ""fell from his cage"". I call desperately for my mom and she tells me he is dying. The next two minutes are complete agony as I watch my bird, *who has been one of my best friends for the last 11 years*, die by suffocating on his blood. At this point I'm in tears, and I ask my brother exactly what happened since there is no way falling from his cage would have caused such severe injuries. He finally confesses that he smacked the bird with a towel. There was no point in asking 'why' since he does this kind of stuff all the time.

Our dilemma:

My family and I don't know what to do with our brother anymore. He is an angry middle schooler and has a history of being somewhat violent (i.e., throwing books at his classmates for making fun of him), but this is an entirely new low for him. He has talked to the school counselor and has had regular sessions with a therapist, but I feel they are useless. His counselors have always given him the benefit of the doubt and held us responsible for his behavior. This troubles me as it removes any responsibility or sense of remorse for his actions. Case in point, when my mom talked to him about what he did he said that ""it wasn't his fault he inherited his dad's temper"". My bird did not deserve to die this way, and I fear that his anger problem could get worse. I will continue to follow his counselors advice and try to understand him, but it's difficult when he rejects advice and gets visibly frustrated when my mom or dad talk to him.

TITLE: [m24] Arranged a date and it was postponed. Am I wasting my time?
POST: A few weeks ago I met a girl, got a kiss in, got her number and arranged to meet up with her. The day before I was supposed to see her, I realised I'd neglected to give/ask for a time so I messaged her to find out.

Got a reply hours later asking if it's ok to postpone because she had an exam she needed to study for the next week. I said sure, let me know when you're free and she said she had exams for another couple of weeks (now finished)

On Saturday night, I was out and texted her saying if she's in the city we should catch up. She said she was staying in, maybe next week. Replied to say ok, will arrange something during the week.

That's where I am now. I will arrange something during the week but does this seem like a waste of time?

What's confusing me is the list of possible outcomes in my head when I messaged her:

1. no reply

2. no

3. yes

4. no, but... (which is what I got)

POST: I dated this guy for 7 months who never called me his gf but would say he loved me and wanted to be exclusive. Caught him ""cheating"" and I dumped him. He begged and cried but I did not give in as much as I wanted to. Now a year later I am in a great relationship and love him to bits but by my own foolishness I reinstated my facebook and looked my ex up. He isn't ""in a relationship"" but the girl he cheated with was all over it. I almost started crying and wanted to punch something, I blocked him immediately so I couldn't snoop anymore and closed my laptop. 

Now he would not add me on fb when we dated and of course I know he never really cared for me because of all the now obvious signs. What I don't get is why this hurt so much, it felt like someone punched me right in the chest. It's been a year since we broke up, I have an amazing boyfriend (who actually lets me call him that.)
 
I've been thinking back and about a month ago he texted me out of the blue saying he had dreamed about me and wanted to know how I was (wtf.) He is a complete jerk and I am glad we are no longer together and as I am writing this the hurt and need I felt to cry are subsiding. I guess i'd just like to know why it hurt so bad and is it normal? Do I still have feelings for him? I love my boyfriend and would never leave him. Has anyone else gone through this?

TITLE: Me [15 M] with a girl I kissed [15 F] about a week ago, do I want a relationship with her?
POST: Hello folks,

Let's jump right in. I kissed this girl at a party a week ago. I really fancied her and the day before I really made clear at another party that I liked her. It was the first kiss for both of us, bit misplaced it felt like but it was alright. Before the kiss there was a bit of flirting and we were becoming pretty close friends.

Do I want a relationship with her? I feel like that asking myself that automatically gives an answer (that I do not). She has send signals that she wants to date a bit. So I asked her to do so, but also mainly because friends are pushing me to.  I don't feel like I love her, and don't really know if I have to. Maybe that is supposed to come with the dating. I am new to all this and don't really know how relationships work. Also I am having fear of commitment (I think), this because I have had a rough time with losing people around me that I have loved so dearly. Maybe it is not the right time for me to get into a relationship if I am having these issues. 

All in all I am a bit confused, don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her feelings and also don't want her out of my life.

Thanks in advance!

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my GF [21 M/F] of 5 months, says ""I love you"" to me, I feel bad cause I never say it back.
POST: My GF and I  have been dating for 5 months now. We were friends for a few months before that. Initially she got a crush on me, and asked me out. The first month or two we dated, our relationship wasn't that great tbh. Mainly because I didn't treat her like a girlfriend. I'd leave and go home after we fucked, showed up over an hour late to our first date, ditch her during out hangouts to go get high with my friends, etc... we had some good times, but overall I felt nothing towards her so I was kind of an asshole. 

After some time though, I started to like her and act a lot better and more like her boyfriend and we started having even more fun, and she started to REALLY like me, I know cause she'd tell me that she ""really really really liked me"" multiple times, and that ""I was the best guy she ever dated"" 

Heres the thing though, she told me she ""loves me"" but she said that she wasn't ""in love"" with me. I didn't know how to react so I was just like ""ok"". But now she always says ""I love you"" before we go to sleep, or I leave or something. 

I never say it back because I still only kinda like her, I'm no where close to feeling like I love her or being able to say it back to her, and honestly, I feel kinda bad about it. I'm afraid that she expects me to say it back sometime soon, and I know that its not gonna come for a while, and I don't wanna hurt her, but everytime she says it I  just kiss her or awkwardly nod my head....how should I handle this? Do you think I should tell her to stop saying it to me until I feel I'm ready to say it back, or should I just keep doing what I'm doing?

TITLE: TIFU by breaking up with the best thing that's ever happened to me.
POST: My boyfriend cheated on me a couple months ago and I found out right before Christmas. We had an unspoken break up and I thought that was the end of it. 

Last Thursday we both ended up at the same bar where he ended up getting in a fight with a boy for touching me in a way that bothered him. I got scared and embarrassed so I left. A couple hours later he found his way back to my dorm where he cried to me and poured his heart out. We spent the next 4 hours together crying until we fell asleep. And i decided to give him a second chance. 

This past Thursday I went to a party with my cousin where I watched her cheat on her boyfriend that she claims to be in love with. This sent me over the edge and my drunk mind decided that if she was capable of cheating then I can't trust anybody. Stupid I know. So I went home and called my boyfriend over at 2am and ended it. I told him I wasn't mad and he didn't do anything wrong. It was a very civil break up and we spent about 2 hours just talking and joking around like we always did. 

Now I regret that decision more than anything. I can't sleep, I can't eat. I've just been drinking myself into a coma every night since then. I keep trying to text him but he won't answer. I know I hurt him, but I think I hurt myself even more.

TITLE: Asking for 1 year old bed time and nap advice
POST: Our daughter, just over 1 year old, won't go to sleep in her crib. She'll sleep in it for a couple of hours if my wife nurses her and cuddles her until she falls asleep. Because she won't stay asleep in the crib, we've resorted to co sleeping with her for both naps and bedtime. I'm a stay at home dad, and can get her to nap in our bed during, but have to fight with her most of the time to get her to finally relax and stop getting up and trying to explore. In our bed, she'll sleep through the night, which is why we've resorted to co sleeping. The main problem at this point, is that even though there's enough room in bed for the 3 of us, my wife and I don't sleep as well because of partner disturbance, and having to be extra careful not to disturb our precious time bomb. I've ended up sleeping on a spare bed outside of the room. We know we need to get her to sleep alone in her crib, but every time we try, it results in sleepless nights for all 3 of us, and by 3 or 4 in the morning, the little one ends up in bed anyway.

We've had suggestions to put the crib in a different room, let her cry and fuss, and we're willing to try that, but I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar circumstance and could offer some advice.

POST: Hey there r/personalfinance! 

I'm a 32 M with an associate's degree working as a server in an upscale restaurant. I just started about a month ago and it's a really great gig and I feel I'm getting really good at it, but I'm only pulling down about $250 a week because summer is our slow season. My co-workers tell me that from October to May I can expect about $500 - $800 per week depending on the shifts I get. I'm also eligible for the company 401k starting in October. 

After some thought I've realized that a long term goal I have is to move back to my home town, or a town like the one I grew up in. Problem is, houses in that area go for anywhere between 350 - 750k (right up to a million). I don't really want to get into managing a restaurant because I don't like the work load/salary trade off. I'm willing to work my butt off, but I don't know if the service industry fits my 5-10 year goals. 

What's more so, I am completely debt free and hesitant to go back to school unless it's for something considered a pretty safe bet. I don't have a lot of people in my life who are older and wiser than me, and so I'm not sure how to plan out my next career move. I was thinking about saving money and heading back to community college, but I have no idea what for. 

I guess I'm posting this because I'm hoping to find someone who has been in a similar situation and come out the other side.

TITLE: I don't know how to achieve my financial goals. Please advise...
POST: Hey there r/personalfinance! 

I'm a 32 M with an associate's degree working as a server in an upscale restaurant. I just started about a month ago and it's a really great gig and I feel I'm getting really good at it, but I'm only pulling down about $250 a week because summer is our slow season. My co-workers tell me that from October to May I can expect about $500 - $800 per week depending on the shifts I get. I'm also eligible for the company 401k starting in October. 

After some thought I've realized that a long term goal I have is to move back to my home town, or a town like the one I grew up in. Problem is, houses in that area go for anywhere between 350 - 750k (right up to a million). I don't really want to get into managing a restaurant because I don't like the work load/salary trade off. I'm willing to work my butt off, but I don't know if the service industry fits my 5-10 year goals. 

What's more so, I am completely debt free and hesitant to go back to school unless it's for something considered a pretty safe bet. I don't have a lot of people in my life who are older and wiser than me, and so I'm not sure how to plan out my next career move. I was thinking about saving money and heading back to community college, but I have no idea what for. 

I guess I'm posting this because I'm hoping to find someone who has been in a similar situation and come out the other side.

POST: MUSIC. For the love of all that is holy, music. I mean, I can't understand when I hear people say they only listen to what's on the radio or they don't buy/download any kind of music they like. Further, there's also people who just get singles from artists that are on the radio and never discover the other tracks these people release. I listen to music every single day and I can't begin to describe the countless situations in which it has made my life better, saved me from a dark place or inspired me to do something great. Music is the one thing I could never give up and I enjoy almost every kind that's out there. I can't stop searching for new music and cataloging my library so I'll always be able to enjoy the greatest artists that have shared their talents with the world. I feel like if you don't listen to different kinds of music or hear legends like Bob Marley, Ray Charles, Michael Jackson, The Eagles, Elton John, etc. then you're missing out on a huge part of your life on this planet.

TITLE: TIFU By Wandering Around Town With Drunk Girls
POST: Last night I went to a party with lots of drinking and possibly drugs. Considering the fact that most people there drinking were underage, I wasn't so keen to be there.   After about 45 minutes, a mom of a  kid who was EXTREMELY drunk showed up along with our schools consuler. Many of us intoxicated, this was scary and the word that the cops were coming got around. Everyone left running and these two VERY drunk girls grab onto me and tell us we have to help them. Having no cars, we had to wander around town and into parks trying to keep these girls upright.  Me and my friend ended up baby sitting them for three hours. We saw so many cops, they puked everywhere. Overall it was a shitty night. I'm mostly writing this on their behalf. Both have VERY strict parents and I'm pretty sure they got in huge trouble.

TITLE: How much to keep liquid for grad school?
POST: I am applying to grad school for fall 2016 and I want to make sure I am being as smart with my money as possible. 

Right now I currently have about $30k sitting in my savings account, (I know, I know, that's why I'm here asking!) about $7k in Vanguard index funds that I contribute ~$1000 to over the course of each year, and I just became eligible to get matching contributions to my 403(b) at my job. (They match 5% if I contribute 3% or more)

I've wanted to keep a lot of my funds liquid because I'm not sure what the future will hold. Ideally I will get into a fully funded phd program and get a 25k/year or so stipend, but there is a chance I will do an in-state not-funded masters first. I still have enough in my college fund to cover the pretty inexpensive in-state tuition for 4 semesters, but I would either have to have enough savings to live on for 2 years, or take out loans. 

So now the question is how much I should contribute to the 403(b). On one hand, I could max it out ($16,500) and not feel a thing even though I only make 30k pretax at that job, because I could just start supplementing my significantly reduced paycheck with savings. Or I could throw in like 5-7k just to get retirement savings started, but still keep more liquid. When I go to grad school, I can either keep it in the 403(b) or roll it over to an IRA.

I know having 30k in savings is not the best use of that money, but will the compound interest on putting a big chunk of it in the 403(b) outweigh potentially having to take out loans for grad school?

POST: Not totally sure how to explain it, but I usually find myself choosing one thing over another because I don't like it, maybe it's ugly duckling syndrome (which I just made up) but I sort of think of it in a way that I can't really put into words.

I will generally grow to like anything over time with frequent exposure, when I was younger for example I liked Pokemon Blue because Red was an ugly colour, and I would generally only like the ""flawless"" actor/resse/s, but with time I would now choose Red, and I think [Toby Kebbel] is a very handsome looking dude.

Does anybody else get this? I imagine these things as being much more mentally stimulating because they're not so ""easy to swallow"", like [Death Cab for Cutie] where I heard it and it just slid right into my stomach where I promptly digested it and shat it back out without ever really noticing.

If it exists, is there a name for it? While I imagine there's parallels between this and whatever the whole ""indiescenealternative"" stuff that cycles around, it's not like that, I sound biased because I openly hate that whole thing, but in a way that's too intense to actually like it for that reason.

POST: I've been on the fence about this but have decided its something I have to do.

We have discussed most of our issues to some length over the past year or so but I don't believe she finds them as problematic as I do.

This will be the first serious relationship I will have to end and don't really know how to go about it. Particularly before and after (i have a fair idea of what I should say during). I'm unsure how to handle the ""before"" because I don't think she will have much warning I do t want it to be a surprise bit at the same time I feel our relationship should be indicative of itself but my friends and family have told me they don't think she will see it coming at all. The ""after"" I think is tricky because we met in university and she didn't have any close friends until I pulled her in to my group of friends, when I leave I believe they will all take my side and she'll have no one. I also don't know what to do in terms of no contact.

I still care about her a great deal and want this to go as smooth as possible.

Issues: (you can skip this if its unnecessary I know its getting lengthy)

She wants to get married and start a family asap... And I want to focus on my career and getting my life on track, I'm not sure if we're even right together to be married. sometimes I think she's so set on getting married it blinds her to our relationship issues. As far as my career goes I plan to open my own engineering firm and this takes a lot of capital which I don't think could be feasible with the lifestyle she wants.

She is very argumentative, little things normally, I pick my battles but lately I haven't had the patience.

Our sex drives are polar opposites, basically the passion has been gone for over a year now and she only does it to placate me... Which is not so much emasculating as it is infuriating.

As far as my career goes I plan to open my own engineering firm and this takes a lot of capital which I don't think could be feasible with the lifestyle she wants.

She is very argumentative, little things normally, I pick my battles but lately I haven't had the patience.

Our sex drives are polar opposites, basically the passion has been gone for over a year now and she only does it to placate me... Which is not so much emasculating as it is infuriating.

TITLE: TIFU by trying to give my number to a guy
POST: So this actually happened two years ago when i was a sophomore in high school but I thought why not share it.

So my friends and I were standing in the commons of my school and I always had a crush on this one guy that was in the commons as well. Cue my friends with great ideas; ""You should give him your number!"" After discussing how I would give it to him we decided that it would be cute if I asked him if I could give him something then write my number on his hand. Cute right?...wrong. I ended up walking up to him and asking him and then going to grab his hand to write my number on it. He jerked his hand away from me and goes ""no"" with a stern look on his face. For a good awkward 30 seconds I tried to decide what to do. I ended up kinda mumbling ""okay"" and walked away defeated. To make it worse he was in a huge group with his friends. Now my friends and I laugh about it but it was probably one of the most awkward moments of my life.

TITLE: Me [19 / F] with my [18 / F] sister. I found something out and I am not sure what to do...
POST: Backstory: I come from a pretty religious home. I have one sister, who doesn't id with any religion, specifically. She is a VERY private person and doesn't really tell us much about her feelings/ boyfriend/ personal stances. My parents raised us to follow rules of no underage drinking, no sex before marriage, etc. This comes into play later.

So, a few days ago I was helping my sister find her phone. She was out of the house, and was making sure she left it at home. (called me from another phone) I found it, and saw she had a few messages on it. I assumed these to be from her texting her phone to find it, so i opened her phone to reply. 

The phone opened upon messages of her and her boyfriend, and long story short, they implied that they have been having sex. 

I realize it's her body, her relationship, and probably NONE of my business to have snooped and found this out. But I love my sister, and I have a few concerns. One of them being, I feel like my mother should know about this. My mom has always told us if we ever did decide to do anything like this, to come to her. My mom is super supportive and loves us both dearly. Also, my sister is still living in their house, so I feel like their rules also still apply. 

I know my mom would want my sister to be safe, and would want to know about this. I am a bit torn. I love my sister very much and really want to let her know that I am here for her if she needs to talk about anything. 

I believe my sister is on BC ( for acne/period related reasons). This is her first and only boyfriend. I just want to make sure she knows the risks and is being safe. How should I approach this to minimize damage in any relationships? Should I just pretend I never saw this?

I told her she wouldn't be a bad person to be stuck with, and she said I'm not too bad myself - the standard lines etc.

POST: Throwaway because my husband knows my username. I'm pretty sure I'm over thinking this situation but thought some outside opinions would be useful. 

I've been friends with Eric since high school. He's a genuinely great person. We have always just kind of clicked, our first couple of years in college in particular he was one of my best friends. I always had a HUGE crush on him, but he always had a girlfriend so I never acted on it. Crush feels kind of inadequate describing it to be honest, I think I was as close to being in love with him as you can be with someone you don't actually have a romantic relationship with. After college I moved out of state and we lost touch, I met my husband and we have been together almost 10 years and have three kids. We have a wonderful relationship. 

About a year ago we moved back to my hometown together and I've gradually started reconnecting with some high school friends, including Eric. He is married now and we double date and all have a great time together. He has a lot in common with my husband, including some hobbies that I don't share with them, so they are starting to form a genuine friendship outside of my friendship with him. 

The problem I'm having is that when I hang out with Eric I still feel like I have a crush on him. We just get along so well, we didn't talk for 8 years but have been able to pick right back up when we left off. I feel guilty about this sometimes, like it's disrespectful to my husband (although nothing remotely inappropriate has ever happened, I would never risk my relationship with my husband). I am a little worried that talking to my husband about it might make it awkward between him and Eric, and I would hate for him to lose a potential friend when he just moved across the country with me and doesn't know many people here yet. So…am I over thinking all of this?

TITLE: How do you regain someone's trust?
POST: Ok, so I have a friend (she's one of my friends, actually!) who's parents are kind of strict, she especially IS NOT allowed to have one sip of an energy drink (it will make sense later, as I tell the story). One day she had a get together with me and to other girls and I brought a monster so I could stay up later. After I drunk most of it I put it in my friends mini fridge and forgot about it, the next morning her dad found it. (I wasn't there when he found it, so I don't know the exact reaction he had) My friend said that he literally interrogated her until she told him who had brought it. That was my first mistake, and apparently her parents weren't really that mad since I never even gave her a sip of it. But the next time I went over there I borrowed her iPad to go on reddit and accidentally forgot to log out. Her mom used it the next day and went through the account (not even knowing what Reddit was) and saw me using some not so ""appropriate"" words (no cussing AT ALL at her house, her parents are especially strict about that rule). She ""interrogated"" my friend again about who's account it was. Also, one of the things i posted was a rage comic about her from over the summer and her mom saw that too, so her mom was extremely POed about me talking about her like that (we had a HUUUUGE dissagrement over the summer, but we have become really good friends since then). I know what I did was wrong but now my friend's parents said that I'm not allowed to hang out for a looooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnngggg time, and defiantly not until next year(they never said that to me, they said that to my friend)! She's one of my best friends, I really want to hang out with her again soon! How do I regain her parent's trust?

POST: To make a long story short, my girlfriend who was new to the medicine floor, left her coffee mug in an area that she shouldn't have, and the nursing manager threw it away.  To be fair, people leave thermoses and coffee cups in that area all the time without problem.  AND, this was a $30 super nice vacuum-insulated mug that I bought as a bday gift.  AND, the nursing manager threw away everyone's items/mugs without telling anyone, while they were standing not 10 feet away doing rounds (she was in a back room so they couldnt see what she was doing, and weren't really paying attention).  Nobody ever explained that you cannot leave items in that area, and when questioned the manager yelled at my girlfriend for not knowing the rules (as I said, they were never explained) and threatened to call the hospital CMO.
TL;DR: "," What are appropriate ways to take revenge on a nursing manager who made my girlfriend cry? 
2. Are there any legal actions I can take to protect my girlfriend's rights in a situation like this? 
3. Are there any other ways to make sure this type of behavior is not tolerated in the future?"

TITLE: EX Wife hates my current partner - we have kids and it's becoming a problem
POST: I'm 28 and my ex wife is 29. We were married for 4 years (together 6) before splitting up over 18 months ago, we also have 2 gorgeous girls (aged 5 and 3). Things were really messy during our split but have settled down. Neither of us were particularly happy in the marriage and it just exploded. I feel like we're both happier people now and we actually get along and have a laugh and can share special events with the kids (birthdays/random beach outings etc) - it's really nice.

Problem is I've been seeing someone for the last 6 months or so, and she is someone my ex-wife was friends with in highschool but fell out with not long afterwards.  This is causing huge problems as my ex wife does not want her around our children, or to even meet her again or have her at events. My new SO has 2 children of her own as well around the same age so it makes things hard when they are excluded from events with my children. The way my ex wife was during our breakup (she lost the plot, used the kids as ammo etc) makes me cautious about how to approach this, but I'm really at a loss as to what to do. It would be nice if we could all hang out and get along (ex wife has been seeing someone as well) but I know that will never happen as my ex wife hates this person.  I'm not asking for us to be one big happy family but it would be nice if we could all just get along. She's even said ""if it was anyone else I wouldn't have a problem with it.""

I'm not about to give into my ex wifes demands here, but I hate that this may turn into a huge problem in the future. Do I tell my ex wife to stick it, or just suck it up and realise it will always be this way?

POST: FH and I have decided to elope because after nearly a year of trying to plan something that we both want in a little mining town, I've given up. Anything nice that I want has to come from the city or interstate (I was DIY'ing what I could but I'm unfortunately artsy in my heart, not my bones) and with every question I asked FH, he realised that it was getting more and more stressful for me, so he suggested we elope.

TITLE: TIFU by driving home from school [NSFWish]
POST: This happened about 15 mins ago, and it was such a terrible experience I feel the need to share it. Throwaway because real life.

So I was driving home from school on one of the busy streets in my city when I noticed my balls were stuck to the inside of my leg. Driving in this position is FUCKING AWFUL,  because every time you change pedals you run the risk of pinching a nut. 

Being the daft mother fucker that I am, I thought to myself, 'hey! I can just reach in my pants, unstick myself, and no one around me will have any clue about what I've done!'

So I commenced my grand scheme at a particularly long red light. I was in the left lane and the lane to my right was sailing by. No one would even notice. And if anyone pulled up next to me, they wouldn't be able to see in. 

I reached in my pants and unstuck my sac from the inside of my leg. However, while I was down there I realized that I had to scratch. So I began scratching. I started scratching like my life depended on it.

This is when I fucked up.

I looked up and to my right to realize that the righthand lane had come to a halt. This wouldn't have been a problem had the car that stopped next to me been a honda or some small vehicle. But that wasn't the case. What stopped next to me was a FUCKING BUS. This bus' angle let everyone on the left side of the bus to see into my car. 

I looked up and made eye contact with probably one of the most attractive females I'd ever seen, hands still in my pants. I stopped my scratching and pulled my hand out.

She just looked at me with this look. One I will never forget. One that said, 'WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU.'

I wanted to leave. I waned to get the fuck out of there so bad. But my light was still red. So I had to sit there, music playing and this girl staring at me like I was some sort of pervert.

POST: Note: I have never been in a relationship nor have I ever made an attempt to ask someone out.

For the past few months I have been picking up my brother [17 M] from school almost everyday. Occasionally, people would ask for rides or my brother would offer rides. There have been few times when a have given a ride to two girls. The first girl I have met in the past in high school, let's call her ""Jenny"". The second girl, let's call her ""Nicole"", and I never met previously and we have not been introduced to each other. Jenny and Nicole are best friends and every time I gave them a ride I always dropped them both off at Jenny's house, as requested.

I think Nicole is very beautiful and I find myself attracted to her. I do plan on asking her out, but in this situation I do not know whether I should just get straight to the point or if I should take small steps.

Here is the plan I had previously thought of: When I drop them off at Jenny's house I will let them take a few steps towards the house before I get out of the car and interrupt them. I call out to Nicole ""Hey, wait! Nicole, right? I know this may be a little strange since we barely know each other but, (complement about how I think she is pretty) and I would like to take you out on a date sometime"".

My previous thoughts was that it is completely normal for two complete strangers going out on a date.

POST: My girlfriend and I recently stopped living together after 1.5 years. We've been together a total of 2.

Things were great at the start until about 5 months in, where we started having problems. I had some old baggage that I had to resolve myself, so I started going to therapy and working things out. She threatened to move out because of my problems, and actually did for a few days, but came back. We resolved our problems, but they arose again a year later (about a month ago). Not the same problems, but this time it was some problems she was having. The household became really toxic and she decided that she didn't want us to live together anymore. I pleaded for her to stay and work on it together as a family, but she decided that we should live apart and work on ourselves.

We've been living apart for about 2 weeks now, but I haven't seen her at all since she went on a family trip. She's back now and wants us to ""work on our relationship."" I'm wondering if I should even bother because I feel a sense of resentment toward her for breaking us up (in terms of our living situation.)

TITLE: I (f22) am trying to cope with breakup with first love (m26)
POST: So I know when we started seeing each other in February 2007 it was a little wrong because I was 15 and he was 19. We were bf/gf but didn't begin our sexual relationship until I turned 16. We broke up for a little bit and got back together when I was 17 and our relationship was legal. We both had infidelities and he decided it was best we broke up at the end of 2009. I was devastated, heartbroken. Wanted another chance... We went no contact until 2011 when we hooked up once and we mutually went back to no contact.

Then in January 2013 we start seeing each other again. He wanted it to be a secret from any mutual friends and I agreed. After almost a year I told him I couldn't take it anymore because we were living a lie and we broke the news to our friends, apologized for hiding it so long. He started telling me he loved me again in July of last year. I was so happy to finally have my first love back... 

Well our relationship has never been all that great. He holds the past against me, accuses me of cheating and lying constantly. We're both extremely jealous and our relationship was toxic from the beginning. None the less this man, no matter what he says or does has my unconditional love.

Right now we are broken up and have been for a little over a week now but have talked nearly everyday. He broke up with me because he didn't want a closed relationship with me and I wasn't willing to open it. Now I wish I would have agreed because we're broken up and I still plan on continuing our sexual relationship once a week... He basically gets his cake and eats it too while I get to feel used and unwanted. I'm so distraught over this.

TITLE: :( My [27 M] ex-girlfriend [29 F] broke up with me. Post-breakup behaviour is odd. WOULD LIKE ADVICE
POST: So my girlfriend and I called it quits a little under 2 weeks ago. Big fight in public with her rehashing things from the past. In the end it broke down to communication issues, nothing particularly harmful that was done to one another. She said it's not longer worth the fight and wanted to break up. I disagreed a few times and tried to get her to change her mind, but she didn't and so I simply caved and agreed. We parted ways and that was that.

Last week she was supposed to attend a meeting for a group that we are both a part of. Even during the break up, she said that she would see me at the meeting and we need to be civil in order to avoid awkwardness. I agreed, and told her I have no problem with civility and being professional in such a setting. Anyway, she no-showed.

I left a note on her desk, basically saying that I couldn't help but notice her absence and that I hope she's getting some much needed rest after working hard the last few weeks. Nothing mushy, simply caring. I wasn't expecting a reply; I actually prepared myself for the silent treatment. As I suspected, she ignored it completely.

Ever since the break-up however, she's posted multiple quotes or ""quotestagrams"" on her social media. My news feed constantly pops up with quotes she's liked. Each about relationships and more bitter than the next. A lot of them are direct responses to issues we had. I'm definitely not reading into them, there's no such thing as that much of a coincidence.

I'd like to understand why this is being done. If breaking up was her idea and she said she was 100% sure that it's no longer worth the fight, then why keep posting and liking these things to get my attention? Is it simply to get my attention? Or is she actually hurt? I don't understand how someone can be so bitter over something they wanted themselves. On top of that, why not just reach out to me like I reached out with a simple caring note on her desk?

TITLE: Did I screw up my FAFSA by supplying half my parents joint income for my separated mother?
POST: I'm currently a high-school senior, and am planning on attending a four year university this fall. I am worried I might have made a mistake submitting my FAFSA. 

Context: My parents are separated but not legally divorced, hence, although living pretty-much separate lives, they still file taxes jointly. I live with my mom, who has been my primary source of financial support since my parents separated. She makes less than half of what my father makes.

When filling out my fafsa, I was unsure how to handle this situation, but after researching online, it seemed that every source I could find (except for official government sites, which were silent on the issue) said the same thing: I should just report one parents income, unless I live in a community property state (which I do, Texas), in which case I should report half of the joint income. This was exactly what I did. In hindsight, I realize I should have checked with a counselor or something before submitting.

Today, I was contacted by my school's automated system, and they want me to submit verification of the information I entered. I'm realizing now that if I was mistaken about how to fill out the FAFSA in my situation, halving all the information from my parents tax returns might look like fraud, particularly given that I won't have the opportunity to explain what I did. 

With this is in mind I have two questions:

1. Did I screw up when submitting my fafsa?

2. When I submit my parents' tax return for verification will I get in trouble with the school and/or the federal government? If so, is there anything I could do to prevent this, by say, forfeiting federal aid?

To the point that people don't understand why we aren't dating. While we do spend a lot of time together, we've never crossed into that romantic plane. We've discussed the issue, but neither of us have ever made a move. We've also been involved with other people on a somewhat casual level. However, despite that fact, I have drunkenly suggested that we cross the line and recently spewed to him that *maybe everyone else was right and we should be together and that he should kiss me*. He didn't. He told me that since I was drunk that I'd regret it the next day. Well, I felt like an ass. I also felt that things would be awkward, he didn't allow that though. And we're still staying with each other. I'm having a very hard time figuring out/accepting that I have those sort of feelings for him, especially considering that he may not return those feelings. He did say though that he had a hundred things going through his head when it came to his past love, his current crush, and myself. I think we both need to just sort things out, but back to my main question, are we really that peculiar in how close we are or are there other people out there with friendships like ours?

TITLE: Me [42 M] with my wife [51 F] married for 4 years, together for 11, just confessed emotional affair
POST: My wife and I have been together for 11 years, and last weekend she admitted to having an inappropriate emotional relationship with a co-worker.  She's broken it off, but she still has to interact with him.

She's started to go to 12-step meetings for Sex/Love addicts, which is sort of a surprise to me, as I didn't really see this.

My wife and I have had to overcome a lot of issues, I myself am a recovering alcoholic, sober for 8 years.  

I am really struggling with this, though.  In all the time we've been together, no matter what, I have never been worried about her cheating.  We have our problems, but I have always felt that at least I could trust her in this area.  Now I feel like I can't, and I don't know really how to process this.

TITLE: [25/M] Pushed a lot of awesome friends away with my negativity/drama. Any way to gain them back?
POST: I don't know why I do this, but I always have sense a young age. Sometimes when I'm at my lowest, I tend to start thinking really hyperbolic and dramatic. Ie: Calling myself worthless, a loser, etc. Or doing something small and start texting shit like ""Omg. I'm sorry. Are we cool? How can I redeem myself?"" etc etc. I'm working on my depression/social skills/etc And since I've been catching up on sleep and doing good things with my time, I've been feeling better about myself recently. 

None of my friends have ""written me off"" persay. Like if I reach out to them, they tend to reply most of the time. However, I don't get invited to social events with them anymore. And I miss that. I'm really introverted/awkward/etc and I have a hard time making friends. So the friends I do have I like to cherish and keep a hold. But I feel like since the bridge isn't 100% burned, I can build it back somehow. I just don't know how to gain the trust back. Any ideas? 

If you have any questions, let me know. The friends that I speak of I've known for 7 years. I've known them for 7 years, but been close with them from 2010-2014 but drifted apart recently.

TITLE: Reddit, how can I address Congress in person?
POST: Recent events have led me to believe that no matter what America says, Congress will not listen. My belief is they are far too busy acting like toddlers to give a single shit about anything that doesn't advance their personal agenda (what with the endless name-calling and blatant sabotage of anything ""the other side"" proposes), and are consequently damaging the country beyond repair. 

Every day I hear or see something in the news that actually makes me feel physically sick with frustration. Statistics show I'm not alone in my frustration, but the powers that be seem to be a tad out of touch with the feelings of the general population. 

Everybody is sick of Washington's bullshit, and I think it's time somebody marched into the House of Representatives and told our public servants to, essentially, stop being a bag of dicks (perhaps with slightly more eloquent phrasing). 

So my question to you is, how do I go about telling Congress to get its act together right to its slimy, slimy, slimy face, preferably without being shot in the face by security in the process? I feel as though bursting into the chamber and asking, as somebody who helps pay all of their salaries, to use the podium is the best way to draw attention to what I have to say, but (and please correct me if I'm wrong) I'm thinking that waltzing into important federal buildings and making demands is not the best way to go about this.

POST: I've been dating the same girl for about a year and a half. At this point, I can still say truthfully that I love her, but we have been distant, in part because she is finishing up her last year(ish) of school, and I am already working in the city. We see each other once every 2-3 weeks.

However, there is another girl at my work who I have known for some time, that I am starting to develop feelings for, although I have never cheated on my gf with her.
Here is the kicker. My gf is going to study abroad for her final semester (4 months), and the non gf ""friend"" is moving away in August.

I feel like I am losing some very important people in my life, and there is nothing I can do. I really feel like I can't tell either girl the extent of the situation, because then I risk losing them both entirely.
Another issue is my pot use. I find that it helps with my depression, which I think is in part caused by the fairly consistent lack of female contact, and no means to get it without cheating. I normally like smoking, but I want to save the money instead.

I've told my gf that I need a break this fall, as I can't do 4-5 months of NO female contact whatsoever. She was upset, but asked if we could still keep in contact and I was thrilled and said of course.

TITLE: Running on a track or running on an elliptical?
POST: Hello friends! It's been a long while since I posted. About a year ago, I was just starting my weight loss lifestyle change and going strong, only to be slightly derailed around last Christmas.  
 
At 90+ pounds lost so far and still more to go, I'm getting back into the game hardcore mode. I had not too long ago stopped counting calories and just mentally tallying, but I'm pretty sure I am a big fat fibber to myself when it comes to portions, so no more of that. In addition, despite my legs' protests, I am starting the C25k program (well, a variation of it) at home in addition to running the same variant on the track at my gym. 

My question is, as the title hints, would running on the track be better for calorie burning than the elliptical, or should I do both (such as elliptical at the gym, running at home)? I understand the importance of cross-training, although elliptical running isn't very different imo from the track, but ""free"" running is far more taxing on me and I feel as if I get a better workout than on the elliptical. The only real exception I guess is that I do intervals while free-running, and I'm at a constant speed (most likely higher than my average running/walking track speed) on the elliptical. So what do you think?

POST: Hi, everyone. My boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months. We are both at the same college, but are currently apart for summer. We skype often. Our relationship is fantastic, and we both love each other a lot. This is just one aspect that I believe I need to work on. I have spoken to him about it, and he wasn't clear--but I think the gist was that hopefully it will fade over time.

The issue is whenever we get into an argument--a real argument or a conversational debate--I feel slightly attacked. And, I become defensive. I, then, start thinking about some of the not-so-nice things that he has done. Whenever he has done or said something that has hurt me, it has always truly been unintentional or him just being slightly callous towards my feelings. I think of things that I have forgiven him for, but it makes me upset to think of those situations.

I know this is wholly unfair to him. If we are discussing a topic where we have opposing opinions, I can't start thinking about a douche move pulled a few months back.

POST: We have been dating for a year now. Things were good at the beginning of our relationship and he'd do sweet things like buying me flowers or taking me out on dates that we'd plan together.

Since we moved in all that has stopped. Completely. It was as if a switch was flipped. I try to suggest things that we could do together and I cook and clean and give him massages and try to flirt with him to make him feel special but he never wants to do anything except smoke pot and play video games all day. (I should say I'm not against those things I don't smoke but I'm an avid gamer too but there's a point where it's too much!) I've tried and tried to explain that I don't feel wanted or desired by him anymore and he puts more effort in for a day or so and then nothing. I feel like I'm nagging and controlling to ask so often that it's driving me nuts!

It's gotten to the point where I'm not really sexually attracted to him anymore. I work out and I've tried to motivate him to go to the gym with me but he says his anxiety won't let him. I love him and I know it's shallow but he's put on so much weight since we moved in that I just... don't feel attracted to him. It also doesn't help that he won't try to romance me or put me in the mood and that's causing more tension for the both of us.

POST: We have been dating for a year now. Things were good at the beginning of our relationship and he'd do sweet things like buying me flowers or taking me out on dates that we'd plan together.

Since we moved in all that has stopped. Completely. It was as if a switch was flipped. I try to suggest things that we could do together and I cook and clean and give him massages and try to flirt with him to make him feel special but he never wants to do anything except smoke pot and play video games all day. (I should say I'm not against those things I don't smoke but I'm an avid gamer too but there's a point where it's too much!) I've tried and tried to explain that I don't feel wanted or desired by him anymore and he puts more effort in for a day or so and then nothing.

We separated about 3 months ago (stress over money led to infidelity on her part and that led to several fights between us).  We both started seeing someone else after separating.  

Today we met up to discuss the impending divorce and after a long(I'm talking 6 hours or so) talk we realized that we still love each other and that both of us have grown up a lot in the last few months.  (Basically forced to because of living situations)

TITLE: I cannot get over my best friend/ex, please help, RA
POST: I dated my best friend one an off for about 4 years. I was always the doting one in the relationship and he was generally emotionally unavailable, but I loved and cared for him deeply. After our last official break up we continued to spend all of our time together and occasionally hook-up, but it was really basic, unromantic sex. More than anything, i would call him my closest, dearest friend. 

After about 2 years of this, I met someone else and my Ex was devastated. He called and emailed all the time and all of a sudden wanted to be this caring, romantic boyfriend. But at that point, I only saw him as my best friend. This went on for 6 months (during which I was very caring, understanding and patient), until he met someone else. He wanted to break-off contact, which I understood completely. 

After about 2 months, I emailed him just to check in and he wrote back saying he missed me. 2 months after that, I called him (I shouldn't have, I know)--I knew he wouldn't pick up and I didn't leave a voicemail. He called back and left a voicemail that was unbelievably vitriolic and said,  among other things, that he said he never wanted to speak to me again.

That was 6 months ago, Reddit, and I'm still unbelievably upset. I don't know if it's just jealousy or a true longing, but I just miss my best friend so much. I can't get over it and I think about him every day. I would not, however, try to contact him again for fear of his response or lack thereof.

POST: I've been reading the many posts about SOPA on Reddit. I've also been reading the relatively few posts about McCain-Levin. I noticed that as SOPA has waxed and waned Redditors posted links about who to call, were giving updates on the volume of calls going into Congress about the bill, and giving blow-by-blow descriptions of how the fight was going.

McCain-Levin is potentially much more destructive to our civil liberties. It allows for indefinite military detention of Americans on American soil. If/when the bill takes effect, the government could declare Occupy a terrorist movement, like the UK has flirted with, and allow the military to lock folks up for as long as they like. This is much more devastating to our civil liberties than SOPA. It allows dictator-style ""disappearances"" and such. 

I am in my mid-40s, so I am a little older than many of you, but I am in the tech industry and I see a lot of young folks coming through. I do not buy into the things many older folks say about the youth being lazy, etc. I have a positive impression of the people coming out of college today. But I see the difference in response to these two bills, and I say WHAT? It makes me wonder if what I am hearing from the older generations is right: that the youth really only care about being able to pirate porn over the Internet and that the larger more important issues elude them. I don't want to believe this, but this situation makes me wonder.

I asked if I could remain on my current plan (The new ones are quite expensive) and the VF sales rep said that I could, and amazingly, the phone was turning up as $0 per month extra!
I happily accepted this offer, and the rep went through all the terms and conditions. I agreed to everything he said, and thanked him for the awesome deal.
The conversation ended and we both went on our happy ways.

About 45 minutes later however, the same rep called me back and said there was a mistake. I could not get the phone on my old plan for $0, it would be $35 p/m instead.

He also added that there was an extra charge of $270 left on my account (even though I was in my free upgrade period). There was a whole bunch of transfers between departments, and a lot of ""only that other department can answer that question.""

What I really want to know though, is whether the first agreement that we came to was (even though it might have been an error) legal and binding.

POST: My Dad is walking out on our Family.  Brief: He is 50 and was going through what we considered a mild mid-life crisis.  It began with vivid dreams that he was making connections to in his waking life.  He is an engineer/scientific mind who now believes he can no longer live in our home if he wants to be the person he was always meant to be.  He is even saying things like we are all critical and he can't stand our negative energy.  He also wants to go live in the forest alone to concentrate on his inner self.

Even more alarming, he sought guidance from a non-licensed psychiatrist with an MA in Pastoral Counseling, and an interest in Reiki (she is an Advanced Pranic Healer) in recent years she has become an Integrated Energy® Therapy Master-Instructor.  She has what I would call ""recruited"" him to pay a lot of money to go to a persons house once a month and seek counseling over skype with a Kabbalah instructor in California.  He is also attending the Interfaith Spiritual Church on weekends.

This stuff is fundamentally changing him, and he no longer enjoys the things in life that he once loved (Hockey, Meat, Friends).  He can't stand criticism and takes any questioning of these spiritual healers as negative energy he doesn't want to be around.  He left tonight and doesn't plan on coming back anytime soon.

Slowly the man I love slowly began to die. He stopped caring about my feelings, he stopped saying thank you, he stopped showing me he loved me, he started smoking more weed, started ditching me for his new friends. It hurt

He then left me. I wanted to take a break because I was so tired of his selfishness and I wanted him to realize what life would be like without me. He ended up saying how he, ""couldn't do it any longer"" and that a break up is whats needed. 

He hasn't msged me or called me or even spoken to his friends about our break up. He has gotten over me and its only been 2 weeks.

Reddit i gave this man everything, i cooked, i cleaned, i did his chores, i helped pay his bills and payed for dinner, i supported everything he ever wanted to do because i just loved him so much 

He then left me. I wanted to take a break because I was so tired of his selfishness and I wanted him to realize what life would be like without me. He ended up saying how he, ""couldn't do it any longer"" and that a break up is whats needed. 

He hasn't msged me or called me or even spoken to his friends about our break up. He has gotten over me and its only been 2 weeks. 

I guess I'm asking why it is i've been so easily forgotten. My ego is really hurt and I want to know what to do next.

TITLE: Can I confront my employer about unfair pay/ discrimination? (Southern California)
POST: For the last three years I've been working for a small biotech company getting paid a really low wage. About six months ago I asked for a new position and to transfer departments (they needed help). My transfer was approved but I did not receive a raise. I thought huhhh, this is in no way a lateral transfer but I'll give it a few months, maybe I need to prove myself first. 

Over the past six months I had far exceeded my department director's expectations by developing a new product in addition to several other projects. My annual review was fantastic (5/5) and he recommended me for a ""significant"" raise. I asked for a 30% raise because that would place me on the low side of my new position's pay range. 

Now about a two months ago the small biotech company I'm working for was bought out by a huge biotech company. About a week ago I asked if my raise had been approved. It was not... surprise! I was told I asked for too much and that I might be able to get a 10% raise. Now in my opinion what I'm currently getting paid is a joke and I believe it to be unethical on this company's part. Based on my research (glassdoor & salary.com), I should be making $15,000 a year more than I'm currently making. I'm pretty certain this large biotech company pays that much or more for people with my job description. 

My question is what can I do? I'm a female and I live in CA. A new fair pay law recently passed that says females and males in similar roles need to be making similar wages. I want to know if I can confidently approach my boss/HR with this law? Any advice would be appreciated! I know I should probably quit but I've been boned for too long to just roll over.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my gf [21 F] wondering If she should talk to her cousin about how she felt about her wedding.
POST: Okay so a little context here I have been dating my gf for 1.5 years now and we talk about everything. Last summer we attended a wedding of her cousin, which i'll call Shelly for this stories sake. Now Shelly and my gf are/were very close growing up and were best friends until Shelly went away for college. This is understandable as Shelly is a decent bit older.

When talking to my gf she stated that she was a little salty about the wedding itself as when they were younger Shelly promised her she would be in the bridal party due to how close they were. Come the wedding time she is told by her mom from the aunt (Shelly's mom) that there is going to be no bridal party just about S and her fiance. Normally only her family would have gone, but her younger sister was going to be on a trip to Europe so she would be more or less alone is terms of age group at the wedding. A few weeks before the wedding Shelly messages her on FB and tells her that she can bring a guest to the wedding if she would like, thats where I came in here. 

Once the wedding day itself comes and we are all seated we look up to the alter and what do you know three groomsmen and three bridesmaids. She didnt say much at the time towards it, but now has expressed her anger towards the situation to me in private. She feels like she is over it and being able to bring me was a compensation from Shelly for not having her in the bridal party. I told her I feel like she should tell Shelly how she feels/felt to get it off her chest and let her know that it wasnt right in her book and that she felt decently hurt by the lie/deceit that happened. Not saying she should atone for the actions in place, but at least apologize and talk out their feelings so there is no long term resentment from her. What do you guys think about this, am I right should she talk with Shelly, or should I drop it and allow her to be ""over it"" in her words?

POST: She and I have been dating for nearly six months now, and she's just as obviously into me as I'm into her.

POST: Never really done this type of thing before but I'm at my wits end with this situation and it's make me feel like shit.

My girlfriend [19f] and I [20m] recently broke up after 10 months because she felt that it wasn't like we were boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.

I've been feeling really stressed the past month or so and didn't really feel like I could talk to her and I'm imagining got a lot more distant than usual. I felt like I couldn't really talk to her as I'm her first boyfriend she would tell her friend about everything which I really wasn't comfortable with (and I couldn't just tell her to stop telling her friend anything).

I am in love with her although I haven't told her and I feel like we broke up for essentially nothing and it could have easily been avoided if we had just talked about it, at the time we broke up I was just too stunned to even really reply.

I really don't know if she feels the same about the situation as I do, I don't know if I should just talk about it because I don't want to ruin any chance of a friendship.

I am her first proper boyfriend so everything for her has pretty much been a 'first' and I felt that she didn't really know how to act in a relationship, this meant she talked to her friend a lot who really liked to meddle.

I really have no idea what to do and I really don't want to lose her, we were brilliant together and I'd really like for that to continue.

We don't talk any more but I know through friends that she misses me. She doesn't have a new boyfriend yet either. Should I try contacting her again? I really can't think of living my life with any other woman but her.

POST: I spent much of this year dating several women casually, and decided to commit to my girlfriend, let's call her A, about a month ago. Things have been good, but not great. I haven't felt a lot of chemistry with her and we don't seem to have much of an emotional connection. I realize I may have committed to her too quickly, and that's all on me.

Before I committed to A, I had been dating another girl (29F), let's call her B. I had strong feelings for B, but she had not expressed interest in a relationship, and we went our separate ways when I decided to commit to A. However, B and I met for coffee a week ago, and she said wants to be in a relationship with me. We had a very long talk about things, and after thinking it over, I decided that I want to end things with A and pursue things with B.

I am seeing A tomorrow to end things, and I am wondering what is the best way to go about it? I want to be honest with her, but I also don't want to hurt her. Should I be honest and tell her there's someone else, or should I make up another reason for breaking up with her?

TITLE: TIFU by thinking a guy calling me was one of those annoying recording phone calls
POST: This actually happened a couple months ago, but I guess I forgot to write about it. It probably wasn't that bad of a fuck up, but I still feel like a complete asshole for it.

First a little back story: A few years ago I was visiting my family in the US (I grew up and live in Brazil), a woman fighting for gay rights on the street coerced me into registering myself and to make a donation. As a bisexual, I am all for gay rights, but I've never been a big fan of people on the streets just insisting on you to register and give them money, but since I am a push-over, it was exactly what I did.
Since I live in Brazil, I just gave my grandparent's address. Which was probably not the best idea since they are kinda homophobic.

Fast forward a year or so, and I am visiting my grandparents again. I am in a hurry to go out to do something, and the phone rings for me, which is odd since I don't live there.

I picked it up and hear a very electronic voice on the other side: ""Hi! We are calling you on behalf of the Gay Rights Blablabla Association to..."". I really really thought it was one of those recordings, and panicked because I didn't want my grandfather to find out, so I yelled out ""OH MY GOD!"" and immediately hung up.

My dad, who was the one who originally picked up the phone looked at me a bit surprised and just said: ""Why did you do that?"" and I explained him that I didn't want them calling me there because of my grandfather and stuff and I wasn't in the mood to deal with those electronic messages. He then told me it was actually a guy named Steve. I immediately felt like a complete asshole for doing so and could never call the number back and had no idea what the association's name was. 

So I am sorry for being an asshole Steve! If you are out there reading this, I am sorry! If anyone knows a Steve working for some kind of gay association, please tell him I am sorry!

Thank you for listening!

POST: I realise I might not be understanding something vital here.. but, as far as I know, people go out to mainly meet new people, and girls get all dressed up and stuff to find a potential mate.

Now, what if i'm dating this girl and we have cuddled and kissed and it's going all good, but she still goes out with her girls - all dressed up, has drinks.. and doesn't even text me once in the entire evening. I might be missing something here. Or I might be a drama queen or smth. It's just that I don't want to waist time on this girl, if she's not serious about me.

POST: I'm on a four-lane highway in the left hand lane, going about 70mph, which was 15 over the speed limit. The highway is pretty empty, save me, a car about 200 yards ahead in the left lane, and a car fast approaching me from behind.

Despite NOBODY being in the right lane, this woman rides so close to my bumper I can see what color lipstick she is wearing. The right lane is completely open. If 15mph over isn't fast enough, she can get over and pass me. The car in front of me gets over to the right lane, and suddenly, I had an AMAZING idea. 

With the woman still attached to my rear bumper and refusing to get over, I catch the car in the right lane and slow to meet his speed at about 60mph. It's a younger male, in his 20s, driving a newer Mustang. I honk to try to get his attention, and finally he looks. I motioned my thumb back, he saw the woman, nodded, I pointed at me and him, and then made an ""ease off"" motion with my hands. He laughed for a few seconds and gave me the thumbs up.

We slowed it down to 45mph on the 55mph highway, hit cruise, and stayed beside each other for the next HOUR while the lady is angrily switching lanes back and forth, tailgating each of us, making obscene gestures, and pointing at her cell phone. Finally, the guy beside me honked, pointed to an exit and waved. I thumbs up'd the guy, mouth'd ""Thank you"", and he turned off.

TITLE: How long do you spend interested in someone for a relationship? When is the threshold to move on?
POST: Dear Reddit,

I'm currently an 18-year-old male with a developed interest in a girl for roughly two years now. We've went out a couple of times with groups of friends and alone as well and I've gotten to know her quite well. Amongst these events, there were subtle skinships and hints between us; at least to what I analyzed. Having graduated high school, some rough events happened between one of my friends and I, who didn't know we liked the same girl and shook the relationships, so I wasn't able to ask her out. This happened right before post-secondary education, as my interest and I separated ways to a three-hour time zone difference. We still chatted through means of technology, keeping in touch with each other as I sustained my attraction. Lately, this Christmas holiday, we got together again frequently and I've noticed that she's changed: becoming more shy, sensitive to touch and individualistic. Upon the beginning of the new term, I've found a time where I'm on a long break right before Valentines and booked a visit to see some friends; coincidentally at the same university that she goes to. Seeing this as an opportunity, I was thinking of asking her out, but I'm questioning whether the mutual attraction will still be there or not. Have I waited too long for something to happen? (Two years).
TL;DR: "," Are there any negative repercussions to waiting two years to ask someone out?

POST: We hooked up with each other and other people before we started dating. Early in the relationship condoms and birth control failed and we had an abortion.

About two years later we're together but now long distance, and last month I visited her. There, she tells me she hooked up with someone right before we became serious in a less than safe manner and it may have not been my pregnancy (and dealing with that ain't cheap). I felt that as we weren't together at the time I had no right to be mad, but the notion that it was someone else's and that it was hidden from me over all the heartbreak really fucked with me. Everything went on ice immediately and I left at the end of the weekend in a huge cloud of awkward.

TITLE: My boyfriend (26m) and I(21f) have drunkenly decided to break up the past two nights.
POST: Sorry if this doesn't flow very well, I'm on my cell phone.

We have been together for two years and have always been open about everything. I have always known he doesn't want children and he has always known that I do want children. However, I don't want children for another ten plus years. So we decided to stay together until then. Being that we're so young, the chances of us staying together that long are slim. I would never press him to change his mind because I do not want him resenting me, our children, or himself. 
Two nights ago we were drinking at home and he told me that he feels like we have no future, naturally, I understand. We decided we still want to stay together, but he wants to be in an open relationship. We've talked about it before, we both think it would be fun/beneficial. I know that right now I can't emotionally handle it though. I'm pretty confident in myself but I'm still a jealous girlfriend. Not overly jealous, but I mean I still have feels. He wants to start the open relationship now because he feels like he's just going to get older and unattractive. He said he understood how I felt and would be patient with me. So we're not rushing into anything. 
We both love each other very much, we're each others best friend. But it has been awkward since then and I feel like he's unhappy or weary. 
Any advice that you guys can share with me? Will it only get worse from here?

POST: Hi all. I got hit with ITBS in my right leg while training for a half marathon in October. It was a bummer, but I accepted that I was probably pushing it too much in terms of mileage, not doing the rights things in terms of stretching+conditioning, etc. etc. 

I essentially took off from running from November through January after seeing a sports medicine doctor, while also doing a lot of cross-training, Theraband exercises, and foam rolling. 

As of this past week, I've started to train for a marathon in May. First few runs went great, but during a very casual jog yesterday the ITBS in my right leg flared up in full force. **Not only that, it felt just as painful as it did in October**. I'm feeling despondent about this right now. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to overcome this injury?

TITLE: My husband [M30] might've done something unsavory with my best friend's [F27] underwear.
POST: It's a long weekend here in Canada, so last night my husband [M30] and I [F27] had my best friend Megan [F27] over for a BBQ & a hot-tub. After dinner, Megan used our bathroom to change into her swimsuit. I waited for her, and when she opened the door I saw her clothes folded in a pile on the bathroom counter.

We got in the hot-tub and my husband joined us about 10 minutes after. We stayed in for about an hour, then came inside and watched a movie, still in our towels and bathing suits. Megan & I must've fallen asleep on the couch halfway through the movie - I vaguely remember waking up around midnight to my husband covering us both with blankets.

Around 2AM, I woke up and went to the bathroom. I noted that my husband was still awake, as the light in his office was on. This in itself wasn't usual - on the weekends he's a night-owl.

At 6AM, I woke up again VERY dehydrated. This usually happens when I have too much to drink. I went to the bathroom to get a glass of water, and this time Megan's teal booty shorts were on the top of her pile of clothes. I am 100% certain they were NOT on the top of the clothes pile when I went to the bathroom at 2AM. 

My husband has a thing for panties. When we have sex, sometimes he'll grab the panties I was just wearing, hold them to his nose and inhale deeply. Given the timeline, I think my husband took her panties into his office, masturbated with them, then replaced them. Right now, all I can say for certain is he moved them.

Megan woke up and left 20 minutes ago. My husband is passed out snoring in our bed. I am just sitting here at a loss, thinking WTF I should say when he gets up. This is the first time anything like this has happened. We have had zero problems with infidelity in our relationship. We've been together 6 years, married for 2 years.

POST: Hey there. I've been out of work for many months, living with my parents. I have applied to a ridiculous number of positions near my home, or on campus but have yet to receive any real offers. 

Background: Full time 3rd year computer science student. I don't have a car. Bus to school. My grades for CS are very good (around 3.8), but overall 2.9 GPA (I partied way too much during my gen eds). Have had many jobs in the past, but have never really left a good impression. Been fired from several jobs for non-serious, yet legit reasons (being late a few times, making a mistake on a credit card receipt). Basically, I have almost no acceptable work references, nearly nothing useful to put on a resume, and I can only really work within a 5 mile radius of my house, or on campus because of a lack of transportation. 

What I'm looking for: Literally anything that isn't fast food. I have been turned down by everyone from CS internships to gas stations. My parents are pretty poor, and they don't like me living with them because I stopped going to their church, and they have essentially given me an ultimatum to leave their house. Awesome.

TITLE: Reddit, any advice for three college girls living with an 80 year woman on how to handle this delicate situation?
POST: So for various reasons I had to find an apartment this year on short notice and ended up signing a lease for a room in a 4 bedroom apartment with strangers. When I first moved in, 2 other girls in their early twenties were living in the other two rooms on the second floor, where my room also is. About a week after I moved in, an 80 year old woman moved into the room on the first floor. Considering I live in an almost exclusively college-aged building and neighborhood, this was a little weird and unexpected, but not really a huge deal.

The problem, unfortunately, is that she is incontinent and smells strongly of urine. To compound matters, she has basically turned the entire living room into an extension of her bedroom and spends all day sitting in there. When I accidentally made the mistake of sitting of ""her"" coach, I quickly found the entire cushion was soaked through. The smell permeates the entire first floor of our apartment. Initially we tried to address this by leaving air fresheners all over the first floor and keeping the windows open. While this didn't completely mask the smell, it helped enough that we could at least go downstairs. Now that it's winter in Wisconsin, we've had to close our windows and the smell is unbearable. It's gotten to the point where we hardly ever use the kitchen or living room, and can basically never have people over.

My other roommates and I have decided we need to finally find some way to address this with her but have no idea how to bring it up. On the few occasions where we've tried to talk about other concerns with her (such as leaving half eaten meat and dairy products in our dish cabinet for days on end) she became very hostile and defensive. I know there are some things you just can't control as you age and I want to be sensitive of her situation, but the rest of us are paying rent too and have been forced into a fairly impossible living situation.

Reddit, is it really possible she doesn't already know about this? Whether she does or doesn't, how could you ever go about bringing this up to someone? I feel really uncomfortable about potentially embarrassing her and would greatly appreciate any advice you can give!

POST: So, my best friend and I are both engaged. I've been dating my fiancé for three+ years and have known him my whole life; she has known her fiancé for about 7mths. This is mildly important later on. 

Her and I have had some problems, basically her putting guys ahead of me (cancelling plans, never responds, not setting boundaries, letting her guys talk to me negatively, etc). Since we both got engaged, I honestly didn't know if I wanted her as my MoH because we seem to be growing apart and her fiancé has been so negative towards me and my fiancé. But she has been my best friend for 10 years and I consider her and her family MY family. I wouldn't know who else could fill her role.

I view her fiancé as very controlling, which is a completely different topic- but as a result I hardly talk to her/see her. Since they began dating I've only seen her once alone, and she was on her phone with him nearly the whole time. 

She hasn't been involved in my wedding planning at all, nor has asked about it. Her wedding isn't going to be for another year and a half- so she doesn't want to start planning yet even though I make sure to ask if she needs anything (she also asked me to be her MOH). 

I bought my dress yesterday and sent her a picture. I was very self conscious about the fit in the tummy- but my aunt and mom assured me that it only looked that way because of it being cinched to stay up. And I plan on losing some weight and wearing spanx. Instead of telling me I looked nice, or anything positive- she basically mirrored all my self criticisms and added ""I hope your ordered a bigger size"". Then the conversation moved to her wedding and her life again. All of the joy I felt about finding my dress was squished by her negative comment.

i've been running for around two months time now, a couple of days a week (2-4 times). the last two weeks i've run 4-5 km each run. this has been done purely as a hobby (plus it's supposedly good you), and i've done no reading/researching until a couple of days ago. now i've given myself the idea, that i want to complete a half-marathon. i'm going traveling start-july, so i have about 5 months; is training for a half-marathon doable (and adviseable) in this amount of time? i have looked at a couple of training schedules online, but i'm confused as to whether they assume i've completed previous schedules (e.g. 5k, 10k training schedules) (which i haven't), or if there are ones that start at my current level of fitness/running capeabilities. if so, what training programs would /running/ recommend? i wouldn't want to injure myself by progressing too quickly.

TITLE: Would you rather be a farmer or a programmer?
POST: True story. I'm a young (18 years old) person facing this almost laughable decision.

I'm a student with definitely above average marks who's going to go study mathematics at university. I also love programming and have been learning programming by myself since I was 13 or so. My objective would be to either do research, or do some interesting and well-paid job at a IT/software company.

Now, on the other side. My father is a farmer and he would like to see me continue its job. He already owns everything I would need: The fields, the machinery, some forests...

I live in Spain, which hasn't any big IT/software/research companies. I've been thinking about potentially emigrating but that's a whole different matter. I don't even know if I'm as valuable as I believe...

On the farmer side, I'm worried about the energy crisis... I've potentially got 60 years more to live and lots of things can happen to me and my loved ones. Peak oil, global warming, population growth, population ageing... all of those things are happening and I fear the possibility of a huge crash. What's obvious is that things must change. What's debatable is by how much.

I think I can do both while I'm at university. But after I finish I don't think they may be compatible. Perhaps I'll have a clearer idea by then...

There's so much uncertainty and so many possible regrets. So reddit, did someone have a similar experience? Am I missing anything here?

TITLE: I think I have separation anxiety? M&F 19-20 together for 2 years.
POST: I [19F] think I have separation issues. 
Whenever my bf [M20] leaves for work or to go back home I start to feel very sad.  I get tired, depressed, and I just kinda loose interest in everything. 

It starts to happen about a hour before I know he is leaving. I wasn't always like this though. We have been together for 2 years, and I've only started this the last year. 

The only medication of any kind I'm on is birth control. I do have stress issues, I have a bit of a tragic background. He came into my life at a shakey time and made things better for me. 

Does this sound familiar? I don't think I should be that sad. He knows I get sad too, and I feel bad. I know its okay to miss him, but once he is gone for maybe 1 week & 1/2 I tend to just stay in my room and sleep. 

Any ideas what is up with this?

POST: For her studies, my GF is doing a project in which a lot of the work is in my area of expertise. As you might expect, she's been asking me for help a lot, and I've been trying to help as much as I can. 

Unfortunately a lot of the time I don't really enjoy helping her all that much. I sometimes feel like she doesn't really understand what she's doing, and is just putting things together in a way that works without understanding why it works. I'll readily admit that I have some (unwanted) elitist attitudes when it comes to my field. I wish I didn't but I do, and they make it harder for me to help her.

In any case, today she was telling me how it wasn't possible for her to do something, and without really thinking I replied something along the lines of ""of course you can do that, all you have to do is this other thing"". Usually you would be able to do the thing she wanted to do, but in her particular case, she was correct that you can't do it.

She later told me that the way I responded really made her sad, that it made her feel like I thought she was an idiot. Of course I didn't want to make her feel that way, but I guess my response really projected that attitude. Instead of assuming that she had done her research, and thinking for 2 seconds about what she was telling me, I assumed that she was missing something really basic and was just wrong.

POST: A few months ago I began feeling doubts our relationship. I was getting interested in dating other people and the thought of being with some us felt appealing. I felt bad staying in a relationship I wasn't fully committed to so I explained it to her and we broke up.

We decided to take a break from each other, no talking or being with each other for a few weeks but we thought eventually we might try to become friends again.

A few weeks after the initial break up we remember we had pretty nice concert tickets we had bought a few months prior to all this happening, we didn't want them to go to waste so we decided to go as friends. 

We ended up hooking up the night of the concert and we decided we were going to try to work on the relationship and entered this gray area of kind of together. We hung out and talked and had sex but it still felt slightly different. About two weeks ago I started feeling like it wasn't going to work out. For the last week we barely talked or hung out. Then we sat down and talked it out and I ended it completely. 

That was a week ago and ever since I've felt hollow and numb and depressed about the situation. Before when we broke up I think the idea of us possibly getting back together floated around my head but this seems so much more concrete and it feels weird knowing we might not ever be together again.

I just don't know if I selfishly made a terrible decision or what and didn't really have anyone else to talk to about it.

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my partner [26 F] 5 years, I work on computer in day to make a living from home, she thinks its ok for her to sit on Facebook during this time.
POST: I work from home. 9am - 6pm. During this time I treat it like a job away from home. I'm a software engineer. So I ask her not to bug me to do housework, and as she doesn't work at the moment during the day time she could get some things done around the house.

Only fair right? I make our income, and whilst she's at home we agreed she would do most of the housework. Although I do help out.

Except she doesn't. During the time I'm working she will sit on Facebook on her phone. She may do a tiny bit of housework, but most remains undone.

Feel like walking out as I feel used. I don't find it fair that I bust my balls to get the things we need and she just scrolls through Facebook.

Am I right to be annoyed?

TITLE: Me [22 M] and my ex [20 F] are dating again, but have some resentment issues
POST: So this girl and I dated for a little over a month and it was GREAT, we had a lot of chemistry, in bed and otherwise. And honestly I had never felt so connected to a previous gf right off the bat.

Issues surfaced because I decided to visit one of my best (female) friends in another city for valentines day. Keep in mind I bought the tickets before meeting the ex. I had let her know from the beginning and repeatedly asked her if she wanted me not to go (she said I should go). I also made several things to make up for it.

Travel day comes, and she decides to brake it off BC of jealousy issues and BC she is having ""family problems"". I felt blindsided because I felt I had done everything to avoid this, and felt like she encouraged me to go.

A few months later we start talking again and dating. The topic of the breakup comes up when I tell her I really resent her for what she did, to which she replies that I ""screwed us up"". Her reasoning being that i should have stayed instead even though I repeatedly told her I was willing to do that if she asked. I am honestly shocked that she could think that, am I truly at fault for not reading her mind? Or was I just really dense in not assuming that was what I should have done?

Now I don't know whether I should still try to work things out with this girl. I still really like her.

TITLE: My (20F) SO (21M) of 4yrs moved 30hrs away without discussing it with me... am I overreacting for being upset?
POST: Okay so my SO and I have been in a relationship for 4yrs, he's great and I love him very much. We have always been able to communicate openly in our relationship, which is why we get along so well.

We both just finished our 3rd year of university. During 3rd year he was looking for a co-op placement for a 16 month term. We had discussed him possibly moving away to another city within our province, which would make it easy for us to drive/bus/train to visit each other frequently. He applied to many positions in our province, however he also applied to some out of province - without telling me.

As it turns out, the first job he gets an offer for is 30hrs away. They gave him around 24hrs to decide whether or not he was going to accept the job. That night we went to his parents house to discuss with them. His father told him he should accept it immediately, while his mother and I suggested he slept on it as he had other job interviews in the upcoming week in our city and other cities within the province. During this conversation, his father repeatedly shuts down any suggestions other than ""Accept it!!"".

Ultimately, without really sitting down and having a discussion about how this was going to work, he accepted the offer that night and that was that. When we talked about it later, he told me that he assumed that I would just pack up and move there with him - something that we had never discussed. He moved to the other province a month ago and won't be back home until fall of next year.

I understand that 16 months isn't the end of the world and that we are young and we both need to make decisions that will benefit our future and careers, but I can't help but feel upset that he did not include me in this huge decision. There's not much we can do about it now, but this has been really bothering me for the last few months.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 7 years, she needs time
POST: So let me start off by saying that I am now in a much better place than when this began about a week ago.  I have gotten a lot of solid advice from friends and family.

We, like all couples, have had our issues in the past.  It has always been small things however, never anything on the scale of cheating or violating one another's trust.  And we have never been afraid to talk things out or tell each other how we feel.  And we have always said that if one of us isn't happy, that we would never want to force the other to stay.

That being said, she dropped a bomb on me last week where she needs time and space to think about what she wants.  Now, out of the 7 years we have been together, roughly 5 have been long distance.  Not across the country long distance, but between 2-4 hours apart.  So we typically see one another once to twice a month minimum during the stretches where we are apart - with the occasional exception to this trend due to outside circumstances.  And we are currently living about 2 hours apart.  We have not lived together either, however the other two years we did live in the same small town.

I've tried to stay strong - and so far have done a fairly good job I think (apart from the first day/night where I was not in a good place mentally).  I'm trying to let her have her time and space.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of 7 years, she needs time
POST: So let me start off by saying that I am now in a much better place than when this began about a week ago.  I have gotten a lot of solid advice from friends and family.

We, like all couples, have had our issues in the past.  It has always been small things however, never anything on the scale of cheating or violating one another's trust.  And we have never been afraid to talk things out or tell each other how we feel.  And we have always said that if one of us isn't happy, that we would never want to force the other to stay.

That being said, she dropped a bomb on me last week where she needs time and space to think about what she wants.  Now, out of the 7 years we have been together, roughly 5 have been long distance.  Not across the country long distance, but between 2-4 hours apart.  So we typically see one another once to twice a month minimum during the stretches where we are apart - with the occasional exception to this trend due to outside circumstances.  And we are currently living about 2 hours apart.  We have not lived together either, however the other two years we did live in the same small town.

TITLE: Me [23F] and [39M] giving me hot and cold signals. I don't know whether I should tell him.
POST: So there's this guy I'm really close to even though I've only known him for a little over a year. I don't know how to romantically approach guys or anything like that. I can always tell when my other friends are crushing / being hit on but I can never do so for myself.

He tends to initiate the daily texts even when he's on holiday or with his friends, cheers me up when I'm feeling down, encourages me to be my best, etc. He buys me a lot of stuff when he sees something that reminds him of me, and I do the same as well. 

I am aware that we have a significant age gap and I know I'm far from mature but we're both on similar wavelengths when it comes to our lifestyles, ideals, etc. We hang out together and sometimes with his friends (and members of his family) too. Every time we're together he always makes me laugh and we tease each other a lot. And I realize from time to time that he likes to rest his knee against mine, even though he has a lot of chair space to himself.

He sometimes would tell me about girls who hit on him and he's not interested. He's confided in me about his past relationships and warned me of guys I should watch out for. Occasionally he says that he and his bros should help me find a guy. And our interactions are strange. He'd hug all his friends (girls and guys) and I'd do the same, but we don't do that to each other. It's never been our thing, and we always have an awkward wave at the end of the night. And one day one of his friends said she couldn't see him without me by his side and I freaked. 

Because of the hot/cold vibes I can't tell if he likes me or not. And telling him feels like such a risk because I might destroy an amazing friendship. And I've never confessed to a guy before, so I'll probably shit myself doing that and be a blubbering mess :/ I'm not a flirty person, so it'll probably be like dropping a bomb on him too.

TITLE: [24/f] I'm tired of having the same fights with my fiance [37/m], but he keeps doing the same dumb crap.  What do I do now?
POST: My fiance and I have been in a million fights about him giving away the only time we have with just each other to his other friends.  I work or go to school multiple evenings a week, and he has his 2 sons 40% of the time. We rarely have time to spend a few good hours together in a row.    

This evening he got home around 6:30 and I thought we were going to have the rest of the evening together.  We go to the gym, and as soon as we get there he announces that he has to go to his house (which he is renting to a friend of his and still stays at sometimes) to snowblow the driveway.  He left three hours ago, and his friend checked in on Facebook with him at a restaurant that he had just told my fiance has a great beer selection.  

I knew when he left that he was going to end up hanging out with his friend all night.  I could have told him to come right back, but then he would have insisted that was the only option.  I know I didn't say anything so that he would confirm my expectations.  He did, and now I'm angry and hurt.  We have fought about this so many times before, and our fights always get explosive and overblown.  Whenever he is criticized, he gets defensive and mean, and then ultimately ends up agreeing he was a dick.  Then nothing changes.  

How the hell do I get things to change? I'm so tired of this.  I know I struggle with my own pride and wanting him to figure shit out because I matter and not because I said to.  We've been fighting a lot lately, and I don't know how I can remotely say something with it not being a huge argument.

I was also pretty pumped to set a personal best for distance in one run though too.

POST: I'm typing this shaking right now, so bear with me.

My best friend of my entire life, birth to now, just called me to say his mom left his dad. But it isn't that simple, as in a regular divorce.

His mom has a very obscure mental disorder, an offshoot of bipolar and schizophrenia. The medication she takes restricts her episodes to occurring every few years and they change each time. We think this is one of them, she was having some physical symptoms, but nothing we could point to. She flat out left his dad, but I don't have all the reasons now.

The plot thickens, as they have 3 sons. The youngest my friend, is 18. The other 22, another 25. The 25 year old has the same disorder as his mom, and is at home recovering from the first episode he had, triggered by a separate family issue. It is very much so within the realm of possibility that my friend has the same disorder, and I'm worried for his mental health. 

He's expressed that he is distraught over the leaving, but feels mentally normal. I need to know how to help him. I guess that the best course of action would to not speculate on the disorder and help with the issue at hand, the grief of his parents splitting. Could somebody with experience in helping people, or dealing with divorce, please help me? I don't know what to say to him. Please, anybody, with anything help me.

Mary and her ex are currently in a custody battle, with the usual stuff flying back and forth, he claims she treats the children like animals, leaving them in their own filth and refusing to change their dirty clothes - she claims he threatens to kill her and the kids whenever he gets angry, hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying in these situations.

Mary's sister sides with the ex, they've got a strained relationship, always trying to make the other seem like a bad mother so her testimony is suspect.

Anyways, on to the dilemna, Social Services have stepped in and taken Mary's children, according to Mary they will be in care until a decision is made on who the kids will live with, is this a likeley scenario in Germany, or is it more likely that she is actually an unfit mother? Mary doesn't seem to be doing anything towards regaining custody of her kids, after 2 weeks she finally told me she'd arrange an appointment with a lawyer, she has no clue what her rights are in this situation and doesn't seem to be in any hurry to fight for her children - she just bought a new house with her new man, in preperation for the twins arrival.

We are ignorant as to how the German custody system works, as we live in the UK but we need to know whether or not my Mother and Stepfather can step in and request custody, does anybody have any experience with the German social care system?

Ideally we want the kids to go back to their Mother, as we have no evidence that she is an unfit mother, but if it is permanent and not temporary and she is just lying to save face, we have a loving home waiting in the UK for them.

TITLE: My sister from Germany's kids have been taken into foster care.
POST: My divorced 23 year old Sister (on my Stepdad's side ) who lives in Germany has 2 daughters, aged 2 and 4.we'll call her Mary. She's been dating a man for a few months and has become pregnant with twins with her new man.

Mary and her ex are currently in a custody battle, with the usual stuff flying back and forth, he claims she treats the children like animals, leaving them in their own filth and refusing to change their dirty clothes - she claims he threatens to kill her and the kids whenever he gets angry, hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying in these situations.

Mary's sister sides with the ex, they've got a strained relationship, always trying to make the other seem like a bad mother so her testimony is suspect.

Anyways, on to the dilemna, Social Services have stepped in and taken Mary's children, according to Mary they will be in care until a decision is made on who the kids will live with, is this a likeley scenario in Germany, or is it more likely that she is actually an unfit mother? Mary doesn't seem to be doing anything towards regaining custody of her kids, after 2 weeks she finally told me she'd arrange an appointment with a lawyer, she has no clue what her rights are in this situation and doesn't seem to be in any hurry to fight for her children - she just bought a new house with her new man, in preperation for the twins arrival.

We are ignorant as to how the German custody system works, as we live in the UK but we need to know whether or not my Mother and Stepfather can step in and request custody, does anybody have any experience with the German social care system?

Ideally we want the kids to go back to their Mother, as we have no evidence that she is an unfit mother, but if it is permanent and not temporary and she is just lying to save face, we have a loving home waiting in the UK for them.

TITLE: Need advice on meeting my wife tomorrow
POST: My [37M] wife [37F] (married since 13 years, together since 15) asked me to leave the house 2 month ago - reason: she tells me she lost all feelings towards me after our son's birth 10 years ago. Both kids daughter 6 and son 10 stayed with her. We had some contact since but the last two weeks we barely sent any messages to each other, yet I have been talking to both my kids on phone regularly.

Tomorrow I am flying to them for 4 days.  As the contact to my wife has become less in the past weeks I think that that is a sign for loosing our relationship. She has not started any chat, always only replies to my messages. Has not called only responded to my calls. 

I am not sure how to behave when we will meet. Do I hug her or just say hello? Do I show my feelings that I am sad and want our family back together or do I play the ""life is good"" part? Should I bring her a gift? (Since I left I sent two boxes with presents to them, my wife said thank you but without any comments or sign of joy). Sent her flowers on our 13th wedding anniversary, got only a thank you message in whatsapp. Should I try to talk to her about our relationship or should I leave this topic out as she always tells me not to pressure her.

They told me it's going to be 200$ for the whole thing, and with 220$ I can buy a htc one on ebay...

TITLE: My husband wants friends, but only female friends.
POST: I accidentally (yes, for real) stumbled upon the ""meet me app"" on my husbands phone. 

He claims that he was using it to try and meet friends in our area. (He is a stay at home father and in general doesn't have any pals)  For the most part, his replies to other people were innocuous, but he recently posted about getting a cock ring and wanting to test it on someone (and we did later that night).

When I confronted him about the app he explained that he wanted to make friends, but specifically, female friends- but only since he hasn't had any female friends since college (which is when we got together). I desperately want to believe this since I know he gets pretty lonely around here with just our toddler to keep him company. He deleted the app at my insistence, but I know that doesn't mean much. 

I want to believe that he is innocent and I'm freaking out, but at the same time, I subscribe to the Steve Harvey school of thinking about heterosexual friendship. 

I'm an incredibly jealous and territorial woman (we're both in late 20s, been together for 10 years), so the fact That he even wants ""girl-friends"" gets me riled.

POST: I met my GF in the same company I work at. After a few long months of pursuing, we finally started dating. Only after a few months of dating, she moved in to my apartment. As our relationship got more serious, she started asking when we would get married. I have always told her that it was too early and that we needed to get our things in order.

We've been very close and happy until this morning when she finally broke down and told me that if I don't want to get married, there is no need for her to be in the relationship. I do not consider getting married - not with her, not with anyone else. I love her very much but she is giving me an ultimatum that I don't think I can say yes to.

TITLE: Me [21 M] dated with my ex [20 F] for 2 years, have been broken up for about a year and a half now, still talk time to time but I want her back.
POST: Her and I started dating before my senior/her junior year in high school. I went to college in a different state for my first year and a half and I broke up with her when I was home over break halfway into my freshman because the long distance thing wasn't gonna work for us and I thought it was for the better.

When I came home that summer we started hanging out, going out to dinner, and having sex just like before. I never wanted to make things official again because I would just be leaving for school again in a few months. I continue this with her til the day I left for school. A few weeks of little contact when I'm at school and she texts me to tell me that she has a new boyfriend and that she is sorry. I was really mad about it at first and thought it was wrong of her, but then again I never put strings on anything when I came home that summer.

Now to the present. A year and a half into college (last Spring) I transferred to a university much closer to my home therefore much closer to her. We have hung out once since then (last Fall maybe), I took her to dinner and we just chatted and hung out with my dog (he's much better with the ladies than I am). When she was leaving my house I kissed her and she didn't pull but I could tell there was nothing to it (if that makes sense). She told me some lines about how she is too busy with school/work/etc etc etc to be dating anyone and brought up things that I mistreated her when I left for school, old issues.

We still talk now time to time, mostly casual stuff about work and school. She is open to making plans though, but assures me her schedule is really busy. What is my best plan of action to make her fall for me again or should I just be done with it?

TITLE: My [27F] ex-boyfriend [28M] is now my co-worker. His sister [25F] threatened to destroy my life if I don't stay away from him.
POST: My ex and I were together for about 1.5 years. We broke up 4 years ago.

He's autistic. He's not low functioning but he struggled with communication and social interactions significantly.  I tried my best during those 1.5 years but it was so difficult. I loved him and wanted the best for him but being with him had become very difficult. So I left. He didn't want us to break up and told me that he'd try to change but he had promised me that too many times before. I don't blame him, it's a disability, but I couldn't stay in that relationship. I knew he'd be hurt so I suggested that he'd get help dealing with it.

Anyway, we didn't remain in contact. At that time I was friends with his sister but she never talked to me after I broke up with him.

Last week I started a new job. I had no idea he's working at the same place but I saw him there. We didn't talk much, only that I started working here. It's a big company and we work in different departments, we won't run into each other regularly.

Today his sister called me and asked to have lunch. I agreed. Well she freaked out completely on me. I had never seen her like that. It was like she hated me in every imaginable way. She told me I shouldn't talk to my ex, I shouldn't even look at him, I shouldn't try to enter his life and if she learns that I've done anything to get close to him she'll make sure my life is a living hell and that I have no idea what she's capable of.

I was shocked at her level of anger and asked if something had happened to him and she told me that I left so I don't have a right to ask questions. She repeated the threats.

I'm still in shock. My mom thinks I should go to the police although I don't think she's a violent person. She was angry. I don't know what to do here.

POST: I need advice with helping my 8yo daughter make a better use of her time. Right now, most of her free time goes to watching fanmade videos and watching a bunch of My Little Pony videos. And then playing video games on the PC. I can see these things taking their toll over her brain. She's kinda addicted and her grades became lower because during exams she's not concentrated but instead she's thinking about the things she watched on youtube.

I need help with maybe some sites or youtube channels that could occupy her but be more productive for her. She likes science, so I'm looking for any kids-friendly science show I could get for her. She likes stories. So if there's any youtube channel with good stories for kids that could enrich her vocabulary or expose her to good storytelling and literature.

POST: I need advice with helping my 8yo daughter make a better use of her time. Right now, most of her free time goes to watching fanmade videos and watching a bunch of My Little Pony videos. And then playing video games on the PC. I can see these things taking their toll over her brain. She's kinda addicted and her grades became lower because during exams she's not concentrated but instead she's thinking about the things she watched on youtube.

I need help with maybe some sites or youtube channels that could occupy her but be more productive for her. She likes science, so I'm looking for any kids-friendly science show I could get for her. She likes stories. So if there's any youtube channel with good stories for kids that could enrich her vocabulary or expose her to good storytelling and literature.

POST: I'm a parent of two kids.

TITLE: Need sex advice: Can't cum with a condom, gf won't return oral sex (nsfw)
POST: My current girlfriend is the only girl I've ever had penetrative sex to orgasm with. We've been having sex using the pull-out method, but the other week I got a little excited and didn't pull out in time. Now, even though she's on the pill, she insists on me using a condom. The problem is that I simply can't have an orgasm in a condom, I've never been able to, and I have rarely been able to stay hard long enough to put one on. 

This problem is made worse by her unwillingness to return oral sex. I go down on her frequently, usually multiple times in one night and then again in the morning for good measure, but she never returns the favor. I don't know if she has any particular reason other than perhaps it just grosses her out, but I feel like I'm being left hanging. 

So my current situation is that I can't get oral from my girlfriend, and I also can't keep it up while wearing a condom, so I'm left finishing myself off when she leaves. 

The condom thing is more important to me. I feel like this is a bigger issue, since I feel like I should be more aroused than I am, and seeing that most guys don't seem to have a problem maintaining and finishing with a condom. Is there a way for me to enhance my arousal, or make myself more sensitive? 

The oral thing is still important too, is it something that I should be able to just ask her about?

I am finishing my associates degree in engineering science and on a whim I applied for a few jobs that I was qualified for but will obviously pay less than an engineer. I was offered a position that I would enjoy (my first real job really) and it pays around 50k. My wife also works and makes 55k. We live in the midwest and have no debt so this would be a pretty good income for us. What would you do?

TITLE: TIFU by accidentally drinking poisonous motor oil
POST: I was working on my wifes small all-wheel drive SUV this weekend. It was a 95 F day with 90% humidity, and I was guzzling water and iced tea all day. I changed the gear oil in the rear differential. The normal color of the special gear oil is a light amber shade, but with 75k miles on this oil, it had changed to a dark cherry-cola color. In order to inspect it, I poured the oil into a emtpy Dr. Pepper plastic bottle, and put it on the work bench for later visual inspection for debris or anything out of the ordinary. Regarding the empty Dr. Pepper bottle- about 6 months ago I went from being a 3 soda a day addict to maybe one a month, in the process dropping 15 lbs. Out of habit I usually have 2-3 emtpy clear plastic bottles saved up for holding automobile fluids for inspection, hence the reason I still had this particular empty bottle. Many hours later, dying of thirst, I spied the Dr. Pepper bottle on the work bench and decided ""wow, that would really hit the spot right now"". A small part of my brain said ""wtf, I do not remember bringing a bottle of Dr. Pepper out to the garage"", but the other part of my brain that had been addicted to Dr. Pepper for years said ""shut the fuck up and drink it !"". I drank it. The moment I took a drink I knew I had fucked up and immediately spit it out- into my teenage sons face who happened to have come out to ask me a question and was in spitting range. I wiped my mouth out with a clean shop rag, ran inside and proceeded to wash my mouth out 5-6 times with dishwashing detergent. Fortunately my son did not get any into his eyes so he just needed to wash his face 2-3 times. - Today I learned that GM Versatrak gear fluid tastes horrible; the phrase ""harmful or fatal if swallowed"" just might apply to me; and that Dawn dishwashing detergent tastes far better in comparison. - After a visit to the emergency room, I realized my doc had a sense of humor when she quipped ""All those times your mom threatened to wash out your mouth with soap, and you finally did it yourself.""

TITLE: I [20F] slept with occasional fling [21M], but found out that my friend [20F] liked him.
POST: So, me and this guy have been occasionally sleeping with each other for the past 2 years. By occasional, I mean like every few months. I used to really like him but now, I'm okay with our fling. We have some mutual friends but both of us are pretty private people, so the fling was kept pretty down low.

Last night, a bunch of us went out and I guess we weren't being as private as we used to be (making out on the dance floor).  Suddenly, he pulled me aside and told me that one of my friends (20F) used to/maybe still is into him, and she told him a few months ago. This came out of the blue for me. And then he basically put it in my hands to decide whether we should hook up, like he was down if I was down. The mixture of horniness and drunkness drove me to agree to sex. 

So I realized I fucked up by sleeping with someone that my friend was into (didn't know when we were making out but I did when we had sex). I feel like I need to apologize to her, but I don't know if she knows I know she liked/likes? him, and she might not appreciate that her privacy was broken. What can I say? What should I do?

POST: We've been dating for about two and a half years. We live together outside our home town away from both our families. He spent his whole life savings getting me up here and has been a great boyfriend with minor bumps in the road. 

The first time I saw the pictures I was devastated, this ex of his cheated on him and strung him along for a long time before he caught her. They had dated all through high school, and he's had 3 girlfriends his whole life (I'm the third) so I know he's the type to get really attached to his girls. He assured me he hadn't looked at them for awhile and that he would delete them immediately (and showed me as he deleted them). I felt bad for snooping. 

The next time I caught wind of the pictures I was more angry than anything. See, the pictures are on his Google drive and I looked through his ""recent"" list, there they were, also further looking at the information details, they had been deleted then restored the very next day. I did not confront him about this because I was very ashamed at myself for snooping especially when I had told him I wouldn't do it anymore. I asked him casually about the pictures and if he deleted or knew how to restore pictures, he ""assured"" me they were gone and he didn't even know how to restore them. 

Today I snooped again, and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm mad at both of us, the pictures had been looked at again YESTERDAY along with a bunch of random hentai I know he doesn't want me to know he's in to (I could care less but he's sensitive) 

The pictures I'm talking about are hundreds.. Of screen shots of old Skype calls, videos, folder after folder.. Things I never wanted to see.

He assured me he hadn't looked at them for awhile and that he would delete them immediately (and showed me as he deleted them). I felt bad for snooping. 

The next time I caught wind of the pictures I was more angry than anything. See, the pictures are on his Google drive and I looked through his ""recent"" list, there they were, also further looking at the information details, they had been deleted then restored the very next day. I did not confront him about this because I was very ashamed at myself for snooping especially when I had told him I wouldn't do it anymore. I asked him casually about the pictures and if he deleted or knew how to restore pictures, he ""assured"" me they were gone and he didn't even know how to restore them. 

Today I snooped again, and I don't know what to do at this point. I'm mad at both of us, the pictures had been looked at again YESTERDAY along with a bunch of random hentai I know he doesn't want me to know he's in to (I could care less but he's sensitive) 

The pictures I'm talking about are hundreds.. Of screen shots of old Skype calls, videos, folder after folder.. Things I never wanted to see. 

I KNOW he's not cheating on me, but I feel like my trust has been betrayed. On the other hand, I have lied to him by snooping yet again, do the ends justify the means? Do I confront him yet again? How will I know he's not lying?

TITLE: My SO [22 M] and I [21 F] relationship completely destroyed but I always catch myself coming back
POST: We've been together for about 3 1/2 years now. We are in long distance about 700 miles away. He's always been very controlling/manipulative about a lot of things. Doesn't like when I go out or hang with friends, hold a conversation with guys who are my friends, etc.

Things hit rock bottom when we both ended up cheating on each other. I slept with someone while he slept with 3 girls. After coming to me and telling me he felt bad, he confessed his 'love' towards me and all. However, I found out he was still hooking up with one of the girls from before and I believe still is even though he tells me he doesn't. My gut just gives me a feeling it's still going on.

I find it really hard to let go because since it is long distance, things could be a lot different between us if we could be together more. That's why I'm always coming back to him. However, after something like this happened, I don't know if things will ever change. 

I don't want to continue to live my life being paranoid and in fear that this stuff will continue to happen while he plays with my head. How can I just learned to move on with my life without him?

POST: Throwaway account because boyfriend is also redditor.

I am f/22 and boyfriend is same age. We have been together for 2 years now. I am in a co-ed fraternity and I'm worried my boyfriend is uneasy about some of the stuff we do. My fraternity is probably 2/3 male and 1/3 female, and we are all engineers. For example, we like to throw kickbacks at each other places so I enjoy doing some brotherly bonding that includes drinking. I think my SO may be jealous even though he tells me that he is not the jealous type. I was in the fraternity before we met so I figured he would understand that we do have parties. We go to school in different cities so we don't see each other as much as we like, maybe 2 weekends in a month if we are lucky. He was also angry at me for not telling him that I went clubbing with them during our annual retreat until I got back from it which was the day after. I went with 10 girls including me and only 3 guys. My previous boyfriend broke up with me, partially because I was in the fraternity which is why I tried to make it clear to him that I was in one when we started out.

In the beginning when he was able to hang out for longer periods, I invited him to some of our parties and dinner thing and he enjoyed hanging out with everyone. Now that he's been concentrating on school, he's not around to partake in a lot of the events.

So reddit, how do I make my boyfriend more comfortable about it? I've told him that they are just my brothers and I have no intentions of dating any other guys. Also, how can I get him to feel less angry when I want to go out and do stuff with them? This is my last year at college so I want to make the most of it in case I move far away for work.

POST: When I met Amber I was skinnyfat and broke. Fast forward to today and my career has taken off beyond my wildest dreams. Im making craploads of money. Last summer a bodybuilder friend of mine introduced me to HGH and steroids. Ive done a few cycles since and my body is amazing.

I get A LOT of attention from women. Which is bittersweet as I used to be treated like I was nonexistant. Horny thoughts bombard my mind all day.

My gf Amber has pretty much stayed the same as when I met her. Shes not very ambitious and average in looks. I feel comfortable around her but I have this strong urge to see what else is out there, all those sexual opportunities I didnt have before are here now... but I also feel guilty and selfish thinking this way.

And I feel worse knowing that a year ago we were planning to possibly get married and start a family. My parents like her and her parents adore me. I get along with her siblings etc. It would suck to have to build all that up again. 

But still...

POST: No earth shattering relationship drama here, but I'm confused. When my husband and I met, we had sex after about a week. He told me that he hadn't had sex in about 4/5 years. As we got to know each other better, I asked him more about his sex life, because I like sharing this kind of stuff. He said that he'd slept with two girls before me (in HS). He also said that sex with them was awkward, especially with his ex gf from High School, because she was very religious.

We've always had a great sex life. He seemed a little inexperienced/rusty in the beginning, but he's great and always takes charge.

So it took me by surprise when I learned today that I gave him his first bj. He was joking around, saying that I'm the nicest girl ever and the only girl who's ever given him a bj. I was shocked. I didn't know that. I asked more about his sex experiences in HS because now I was curious. Well, aparently he's only had sex with one girl, but he was ashamed to admit that to me so he said it was two. Also, this one girl only wanted to have anal sex with him, because she was religious, and I guess she thought that that wouldn't piss god off as much. My husband says that they only had sex a handful of times, and that it was awkward and 'forced' (not as in non-consensual, just with no passion. 

I feel really weird about this - did I take his virginity then?  Is it okay if I'm a little annoyed, because it feels like he lied to me? I just feel superweird about this. Of course not like 'I want a divorce!' W

TITLE: [CA] Possible consequences of welfare shenanigans.
POST: Several months ago, my wife and I had a large fight which resulted in my expulsion from the home via restraining order for 10 weeks. I have since resolved (most) of the issues with my wife, but one thing continues to plague both of us.

While I was out of the home, she filed the necessary paperwork to begin receiving benefits from the State. This included CalWorks, a cash benefit, as well as CalFresh, effectively food stamps. She also is receiving assistance for tuition and books at school.

When she signed up for everything, she truthfully advised the social worker that we had 2 kids, and that she was making zero income. The benefits she is receiving were calculated based on those figures. 

Now that I am back home, she is terrified that she is going to get into trouble for taking unauthorized benefits. She told them as soon as I moved back in that I was there, but at the time, we were still working out what would happen with out relationship, and I moved back in purely to avoid having to pay rent at two locations. Nesting is the term, I believe. 

To this day, our relationship is still strained, and we still fight. So much so that she has expressed to me that she still has moments of doubt about where we are going. That is something for /r/relationships though. What I'm wondering is what kind of trouble she could get in to, if any? She has admitted to the social worker that I am back in the house, but I don't know if she formally filed any paperwork alerting them to the change in status. The circumstances regarding our relationship are the same now as they were then: I live there, and we are amicable, but we are more roommates than partners.

The 5 year old can be a hellraiser but he's a good kid.  The 2 month old is..a baby.  He does baby stuff.  He's pretty relaxed, unlike a lot of babies I've seen. Doesn't cry a lot, etc.  We treat him with kid gloves, obviously.  He's a baby.  We're gentle. 

Tonight, she calls and says to me, ""I hate to lose a babysitter but there's a bruise on the baby's back that wasn't there yesterday.""  

This pissed me off, and I repeated what she said back to her, absolutely shocked and confused.  I then handed the phone to my SO, who asked her a few questions, then hung up.  She called the woman back a few minutes later, explaining that we were both very offended that she would accuse us like that.  She claimed that she didn't mean to make it an accusation, and now that she's thought more about it, she thinks it happened when she put him in the sink for his bath, that the sink stopper might have done it.

About a year ago I met someone online. I had a few dates with this person until he told me how great and wonderful I was but he decided to see someone else. The positioning of his rejection seemed to me that he was rejecting me for my weight, which was 242 at the time.

Over the course of the last year I have dropped my weight to 180 for a 62lb loss. I was happy with myself even though I could still be more little in the middle. 

I decided to try dating again and met someone who I found great comfort being around and to be a wonderful person in general. Things were progressing along swimmingly until recently. After a great date in the park with dinner and drinks things started heating up. About ten minutes in he stopped, looked at me with the saddest face, and said, ""I'm not physically attracted to you and I don't want to continue this relationship."" I was crushed. We talked for about an hour afterwords. As far as breakups go it couldn't have gone better. He said something that resonated with me. He said it more delicately but the gist of it was ""I think you are attractive but I can't get passed your body.""

Now to what brings me here. I've been working hard to get to this point in my weight loss. I just started yoga and have been feeling great. The end of this wonderful romance has made me question myself and my body. I'm disappointed in myself for not trying harder or not seeking out help when I needed it.

I decided to try dating again and met someone who I found great comfort being around and to be a wonderful person in general. Things were progressing along swimmingly until recently. After a great date in the park with dinner and drinks things started heating up. About ten minutes in he stopped, looked at me with the saddest face, and said, ""I'm not physically attracted to you and I don't want to continue this relationship."" I was crushed. We talked for about an hour afterwords. As far as breakups go it couldn't have gone better. He said something that resonated with me. He said it more delicately but the gist of it was ""I think you are attractive but I can't get passed your body.""

Now to what brings me here. I've been working hard to get to this point in my weight loss. I just started yoga and have been feeling great. The end of this wonderful romance has made me question myself and my body. I'm disappointed in myself for not trying harder or not seeking out help when I needed it. I have some lack of motivation today for a combination of having my love life snuffed out in a single sentence and a disappointment with my body. I don't know where to go from here.

TITLE: BK, Relief from Stay, and Selling the Loan
POST: Here is a situation I've come across and am interested to hear about the legal ramifications.  Not looking for ""official"" legal advice, just thoughts on the situation.  

BK declared in 2011.  The bank obtained a relief from stay in April 2012 and since that time Borrower has been calling them trying to get the ball rolling on the foreclosure process.  Borrower's ex is unwilling to do a Short-Sale or work toward a DIL for some reason; they are now officially divorced and the only alternative (because it's the only one she is willing to move forward on) is foreclosure.    

Borrower just found out that the bank has sold his loan to another bank. The process is likely to start all over again with ""what can we do to modify this loan for you"" and that will take months to wade through. Good times.

My question is this: If the Borrower's old bank was the one who pursued the relief from stay under the terms of the BK, can that relief from stay just be essentially transferred to the new bank and new servicer?  I understand that the relief from stay allows the old bank the ability to pursue options with respect to moving forward with foreclosure, but can they just sell the troubled loan to another company with the relief from stay in place?

TITLE: I [20M] wanted a break with my GF [ 19f] of 1.2 years, now I need help to get her back
POST: My gf and I had broken up about a month ago for constant fighting to, IMO over pretty mundane stuff. We hadn't fought before then really, but we are at different schools about 5 hours apart and the distance finally got to us.

Initially it was just a break, she needed space and so did I. However, I tried to reconcile things last week. She said she didn't want to do distance, saying it made her always miss me and held her back socially. But kept sending mixed signals like she wants to date in the summer around may and how she still feels about me. The discussion ended on poorer terms than I would of wanted. Largely due to me.

I don't know what to do. I personally can't take a pause, I feel like Ill lose the intimacy we had and maybe even her. She's has gone the entire year but bails when we are so close to being together for the summer.

Should I continue giving her space for a few more weeks then speak to her again? If so what line should I take? I don't want to sound desperate.

POST: This wont take long, ill give a brief summary of the relationship and then ask the question, I think this is the right subreddit, if not my apologies.

We have been ""together"" for around 8 months now, we dont see much of each other because she is busy so much (she has a kid and a very busy job).  She said I was her boyfriend fairly early on but we havent seen much of each other so Ive never really felt it.

So basically in 8 months ive seen her twice.  I think you can see why I never really felt it.

Anyway the question: earlier today we were talking about this kind of thing and she doesnt think its fair to me to ""have"" to wait even though I said im okay with that.  

She suggested having a ""break"" and thats something Ive never encountered before.  I went along with it because I striaght out told her that if she wanted to end it I would respect her choice and I meant that, I really have a lot of respect for her intelligence.

I get what it means, she wants to be apart for a month or two (her words) and then see how we feel, but given how we almost never see each other this seems more to me like a break up than anything.  Am I wrong in thinking that?  

Cause this sounds to me like just a very slow way for her to break things off.

TITLE: House-soiling issues with an 11 year old dog.
POST: Hello,

I'm unsure whether there is a questions thread or whatnot where I can ask the question I have so I made a post instead. Growing up, we had two dogs for the better part of 10 years and recently had to lose one to illness. Our current dog is an 11 year old Pointer mix who was never properly house-trained during those 10 years and has therefore developed house-soiling habits. Growing up I never really paid attention to it as I figured my dad whom had read a few books on the matter had claimed we could fix these habits. I've recently come to understanding that everyone in the house has simply given up on fixing this issue and it annoys me. With a new dog coming into the picture later this summer and a lot of free time this summer I'd like to fix this issue. 

The dog, Ella, has habits of peeing on a training pad at the front door anytime we leave the house or when we go to bed. When she notices we go upstairs to get to bed in the evening, she will within 5 mins, pee on her pad, regardless of whether she's been out for a walk or in the backyard in the past hour. When we leave for extended periods of time(4+ hours) she will poop in the living room creating quite the unpleasant smell for a few hours. 

A relative dog trainer has proposed changing where the training pads are to putting them beside the backdoor, and then gradually showing her to go outside. I've attempted to move the training pad and she will generally move her soiling area to where the pad is however, I'm uncertain on how to go about showing her to go outside or rather how to not pee in the house as I don't believe her issue is a lack of understanding that outside=toilet but rather that her issue stems from the lack of understanding that inside=/= toilet.

Any tips or help in how to break this habit? Will a new dog pick up this habit if the older dog does it?(our 1st dog did not) I'm sorry if the text is long.
TL;DR: "," What strategies can be used to break an 11 year old dog's house-soiling habit?

I have worked through this and for the last few years have finally been happy. I am living the life the way I want it now, have projects, friends, hobbies, travel etc. But what I haven't been able to find is a genuine man who really is available for true love.

Yes, I know, most people want relationships and love, but that doesn't mean they're truly ready to find their soulmate, stick with her or him to the end, be each others best friend, be completely vulnerable with each other etc.

It just feels like every guy I date has some major hang ups concerning relationships and that's why they're still single in their 30ies. Like they don't want committ, they want the player's lifestyle, or they have some racist or other views I cannot deal with. Or an addiction problem, mostly alcohol. Most guys I meet also seem to have someone somehow, either just sleeping with them, texting them etc. No one is truly available.

I feel like my difficult life has made me miss the chance to meet a guy who is interested in the same thing I am: committment, marriage, children, have a good, stable, drama free, drug free life, being kind to each other, making each other happy, being content just to watch a good movie together, have a nice dinner, tell each other all the stories, be there for each other through the good and the bad days... well you know you get my drift.

BTW: No, I am not saying it is impossible to get married at my age or just to find someone. This is never hard I guess. My issues is to find someone who is just as romantic and ready for the big deal just like me and doesn't have any major hang ups as described above.

I feel like my difficult life has made me miss the chance to meet a guy who is interested in the same thing I am: committment, marriage, children, have a good, stable, drama free, drug free life, being kind to each other, making each other happy, being content just to watch a good movie together, have a nice dinner, tell each other all the stories, be there for each other through the good and the bad days... well you know you get my drift.

BTW: No, I am not saying it is impossible to get married at my age or just to find someone. This is never hard I guess. My issues is to find someone who is just as romantic and ready for the big deal just like me and doesn't have any major hang ups as described above.

TITLE: I'm [m25] and she's 24 and I don't think I can handle being in an open relationship with her anymore
POST: We started off as friends with benefits about 6 months ago. This is probably the longest FWB I've had in the past 3 years. Usually these relationships only last 1-3 months at most. I've never developed any emotional attachment to my previous hook up buddies and now I've gotten myself into a sticky situation. I for once actually care. I've tried hooking up with other girls since we're in an open relationship but I simply feel too guilty even after just making out with another girl. Before, I had no problem fucking two different girls in one day but I actually feel bad. Like I'm doing something wrong when in reality I know I'm not. She has given me the permission to go and sleep with whoever I want.
This has been the most drama filled friends with benefits relationship I've had. About every month she wants to break it off, so we do but then we always end up resuming where we left it off. Well in the past few weeks I've been thinking really hard about how I feel about her and I would really like to date her exclusively. Last night definitely reaffirmed it when I tried hooking up with another girl and I just kept thinking about her and like I said before I've never felt guilty about hooking up with other girls before until now and the worst is we are in an open relationship. I finally have what I always wanted. Someone I can hang out with and I get to have a great time and she also lets me see whoever I want. But the problem is I don't want that anymore. I'm pretty sure I couldn't handle the thought of her being with someone else. I definitely know that shes the only girl I want to be with at the moment.
I also know she really doesn't want a relationship. This is her first friends with benefits she ever had. I can tell she really enjoys the freedom of being able to do whatever she wants and not be constricted to only one person.

Anyways, judging from old patterns I can only wonder when she wants to just be friends again. I'm torn between ending it now before I become even more attached than I already am or should I just stick it through and see what will come of it.

POST: If your SO cheated behind your back with other women/men, would you want to know? Or be left in the dark? 

If you knew of someone that fucked with other girls behind his girlfriend's/wife's back, would you tell the SO that didn't know? 

Background to my question that I hope to get some kind of insight into: 

My SO and I split up [both mid 20's]. 
We are together again now. While apart, she left her FB logged in on my computer, and like an asshole, I read her messages. Discovered some guy messaging her sexual flirty things and that his girl was out of town etc...she went with it (damn, still hurts to think about). 
I don't think my SO knows that I know...
I contemplate emailing the guys SO very subtlety...I don't know though, I know what it's like to be on that end, and I don't want to hurt someone. But I also don't want to sit back knowing this coward can get away with this shit. I'm torn.

TITLE: What is the point of the Occupy Wall Street?
POST: First time poster but long time lurker! As a someone with an extensive Finance background I am struggling to understand the point of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The government did ""bailout"" the banks however, they simply invested money into a system and received a return on investment in return. Yes, Wall Street CEOs get paid tremendous amounts of money but they also have a very high risk/high reward job. If they are successful they should be rewarded as such. If they fail they should be pushed out like many are. Shouldn't the correct focus be on Washington and their failure to prioritize correctly? We have leaders making decisions on sectors of our country that they have no experience. Having a lawyer make business decisions of the country is the equivalent of having a mechanic perform surgery. Help me understand because right now I dont feel as if those within the movement understand the whole picture.

My problem is that in my head, I keep wanting to call him by my ex's name.  For example, we'll be cuddling and I'll want to say ""Love you [ex]"" instead of my boyfriend's name.  (For context, my first boyfriend and I broke up almost 6 years ago and dated for less than a year.  Also, my boyfriend's and my ex's names are not similar in the least!!)

This is really starting to bother me.  I took time off dating because my ex was such a royal eff up, and I had to learn what I wanted before I could date again.  There's no way in HELL I'm still pinning for him, so why do I keep wanting to say his name?  Am I really making more of a deal of this than it really is?

TITLE: Me [17M] getting too attached to online girl [16F]
POST: I basically met this girl online, and we hit it off straight away. We texted every day and stayed up until 4am every night. There's even been two occasions where we stayed up until 6am on a school night and I ended up missing school. There have been a few skype calls as well, and this connection we have is great but...

It's only been a month and I'm incredibly attached to someone I've never met, and it's bugging me. When I'm trying to study I'm thinking about her. I just think about her a lot, and since it's exam season there's nothing I can really do to occupy my mind other than study, which is just hard. I don't know what to do.

We've always talked about taking breaks in talking because it was getting ridiculous but it never happened - until now. We haven't really texted properly in 3 days and I guess it's because she's feeling this too and wants to distance herself maybe as I know for sure she has feelings for me too. However it sucks, so much, and I just want to talk to her, but I keep stopping myself.

We've set up to meet after exams so that we're stress free but I want to meet her sooner. It's TWO months. I've gotten incredibly close with this girl and not talking to her just makes me feel shit, but I do want something with her in the long term, so should I just stop talking to her for a while, and if she texts me, then so be it?

It's not like I don't have any friends or I don't speak to any other girls but this girl in particular I've just grown to like so much, shit. I just don't know.

POST: So I've been seeing this girl for a month now and she's wonderful in almost every way, except she hates everything about herself (note: she is not depressed, she is incredibly insecure). Now me on the other hand: I'm easygoing and rarely get angry or annoyed by people, I go out of my way to make others happier, and I don't like to think about my own emotions (this last part is important later). 

Today I decided that we need to talk about her insecurity because its starting to pervade into every conversation we have, and she told me that she doesn't want to change her personality for a relationship. This is fine by me, I've known her for a month and I have no place telling her who or what to be. But she was visibly upset by this conversation and asked me what exact traits I liked about her. On the surface of it, I think she's pretty, smart, driven, and lots of great things. But that wasn't the type of answer she was looking for- ""I like you because you're so unique and rare personality-wise for XYZ traits, there's lots of pretty and smart girls"". So I agreed to go back home and seriously introspect on it because it wasn't something I'd ever thought about. 

Now I'm sitting here thinking this.

I do like her and I still can't put words to *why* I do, but the more I think about her personality, the more I realize that she isn't ready to be in a relationship yet.

Current doubts: Accepting the worst of my past, being able to move together to another part of the country, pursue progress and life for as long as we live.

Regarding my past; I have brought it up a bit and shocked her. It doesn't seem like it's an important thing in our relationship, but she doesn't want to hear more of it.

---------------

Ms. Re-entry. There was crazy passionate love. We were more open with each other than with anyone ever, but I couldn't close the flood gates and she was scared/not mature enough to be up front with me and it ended poorly after a short time. Nearly 2 years later, we are both aware of the mistakes we made, apologized and are back on excellent terms with romance clearly still existing passionately between us.

I have been thinking about this for weeks and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Oh, and though I'm sure a lot of y'all will feel the need to tell me that I am doing something horrible, I hope you can refrain from that. I'm very confused and understand how horrible I am at this moment but I can't wrap my head around all of this and that is what I'm here for.

POST: Hi reddit, 

My boyfriend [20M] and I [19F] have been dating for two years. We are long distance, maybe a couple hours a part, but we skype quite often; typically we skype for 1.5-4 hours a day ( its not all talking, its more the the comfort of the presence), and let the call run through the night as we sleep which has become routine. 
However, he recently asked for a bit of space, requesting that we limit our calls to one hour a day, but during that time his whole attention will be on me. I'm completely okay with that, it was a bit of a hit to the ego, but if it's what he wants, okay. 

However, 'tis that time of the semester. Exams, and with that being said he doesn't text, doesn't message, doesn't call, and our communication is basically non-existent. And when he does talk to me  it's because I've put in the effort in first. There's no call for one hour as he had said and  I get that school is important, but I've really taken a back seat. This phase will end at the end of his exams which is in three weeks, but I'm pretty sure it'll be similar re-occurring events every time exams come around. Is this normal for most relationships?

TITLE: Should I [21M] stop dating [24F] because of behavior in a her previous relationship?
POST: A few weeks back during the start of the  school semester I met a girl who it seems that I've clicked well with. We've been hanging out constantly, going to the gym, studying together,  and have gone on several dates. Everything has been going great. However, I think there might be a red flag with her. 

The other night we went out for dinner and then went to the park where we ended up talking for a couple of hours. The conversation led to her mentioning how she was in a shitty relationship with a ex boyfriend form a while back and how they would cheat on each other. My first thought was that this was a deal breaker for me since from what I can tell, people who previously cheat in relationships tend to follow that behavior in future relationships. But then she further explained that her cheating was never physical, only emotional. In my mind, cheating is cheating, but she then further explained that her relationship with this guy was right during the time that her parents were divorcing which was pretty hard on her. 

She told me me how she was very depressed during that time because of her parents divorce which made me think that her emotional cheating was a way of looking for support since her boyfriend wasn't really there for her. She also explained that the relationship was a huge wake up call for her since up until the end of that relationship, she never took her relationships serious. Her mentality was backwards in that if the relationship faced a road block she would want to to break up instead of trying to over come it. 

For the most part, I feel like I should continue to date her and see how things pan out.

TITLE: Ex-gf [21f] wants to have sex with me [26m]
POST: She cheated on me 4 months in and felt compelled to tell me near our 6 month mark. 

We fought about it for a week. Lots of lies and anger. In my head I was on a see-saw of forgiving her and moving on, or leaving her. I decided, for the time being, to leave (move out).

During the few days where our relationship was in the dumps we would talk multiple times a day and agreed to see each other on the weekends to see if what we had was salvageable. 

In the meantime she ended up being consoled by some guy whom she had just met: she told him everything about what had happened, then cuddled with him in her bed, then went to his room and did the same. This was the 2nd time she had met him, the 1st was an exchange of hellos. I was told a milder version of this story at first, then the full version after some prodding, much like her cheating story. I decided to drop her and completely ignore her.

Since then shes been texting and calling at an alarming rate. At first the texts were mundane and friendly, mostly about getting closure. They slowly turned desperate and needy. The last 6 texts I got were in the early morning hours, telling me about how horny she was and that she misses the sex and how we used to be. 

I admit, I have been thinking about visting her for sex. Strangely, the sex got better after all the cheating drama. Do you guys think its a good idea? Or should I continue ignoring her and move on with my life?

POST: So I was texting a girl (yes I like her) and a few texts later her friend starts to answer. Anyways her friend calls me and puts me on speaker and she starts messing with me along with her other friends. I asked where the girl was and they claimed she was in the bathroom, then I asked if she knew they were doing this and they just said ""Yes and no.""

Anyways I heard a voice in the background (sounded male) say ""well they're practically dating"" and I think this refers to how I spent three hours with her at a cafe after an engineering club meeting. Yeah we talked nonstop until I had to go so I hope that went well.

So what's going on? Is this good or bad?

My friend told me that she could be flirting or something, but my other friend told me that this usually means she doesn't care if she's letting her friends handle it and if its the latter, then it feels like I just got kicked in the chest.

POST: So yeah, he's been my friend for so long and I've always had a thing for him and he's always had a thing for me. We had a brief falling out five years ago and shortly after that he started dating someone else, and then I started dating someone too. 

We became friends again and it was nice. 

So in the summer he split up with his girlfriend and it was really hard on him. And recently I split up with my boyfriend. Since then my feelings for him have increased exponentially. We talk all the time and I really want to be with him. He is worried that I'm just getting over my relationship and that my feelings for him will wane. I don't believe so, since I've always liked him. Also, because of his difficult breakup he is having a hard time trusting women, which I totally understand. 

He is really careful and wants everything to be perfect, but I feel like there's no time like the present and there is never going to be a perfect time to be together and we never know if we will work out unless we try. Everything is a risk, right?

There are so many newer movies/TV shows that are as good (if not better) and technologically brilliant which people don't give as much credit to. The Matrix trilogy, Terminator series, LOTR, Jurassic Park and Avatar to name a few. *Battlestar Galactica*, for heaven's sake. How can someone prefer Star Wars over *that*? 

And yet, we still have everyone and their mothers reference Star Wars in every setting to gain some geek credit. Still have multiple Star Wars themed Superbowl commercials every year. *Why?*

I went to a reasonably rich private school, but despite having its own upstairs cafe, the food was horrible and overpriced. At this point, some of my friends were getting their driving licenses, and would drive to fast food places to get their own lunches. My dad would give me his debit card to buy food since he couldn't always give me cash.

I was stupid enough to lend the debit card to a friend so he could buy me lunch. I gave him the number and account and he'd bring the food+card back within 10 minutes. But one day my dad was going through the bank statements and he noticed someone had taken out over $1000 at the local mall. Guess who? Yeah.

My parents made me give them my friend's phone number and they texted him, saying they were going to call his parents and the police if he didn't pay it back. He owned up and said it was because he owed a friend a lot of money. Pathetic excuse. He also said he was going to pay them back ASAP.

POST: I posted this in r/legal but I thought I might get a better response here. 

My mother works at a small family owned pharmacy in Florida as a pharmacy technician . Whenever she requests to use her vacation days it is always a huge ordeal.

Recently, my mom requested vacation days so she could be with my cousin who is coming from out of the country. The manager called her into the office and asked her to work weekends to make up for the days she is requesting. That is unacceptable, these are her paid vacation days that she hasn't used for the year. She declined and the manager insisted that she work at least half days on the days she is requesting. 

Throughout the year, every time my mother has requested to use her days she has been denied or the days have been rearranged in a way that is convenient for the manager and inconvenient for my mom because she is given no choice.

Last year, it came to the point where they didn't allow her to take any days off and gave her a check for the remaining paid days off instead.

Essentially they are not allowing her to take her time off and paying her for it instead without giving her a choice. I don't think this is ethical.

I would like to know if there is anything that can be done or if this is even legal. 

There is no HR department in this company, all of the issues are handled by either the manager or the vice president (who are related).

Recently, my mom requested vacation days so she could be with my cousin who is coming from out of the country. The manager called her into the office and asked her to work weekends to make up for the days she is requesting. That is unacceptable, these are her paid vacation days that she hasn't used for the year. She declined and the manager insisted that she work at least half days on the days she is requesting. 

Throughout the year, every time my mother has requested to use her days she has been denied or the days have been rearranged in a way that is convenient for the manager and inconvenient for my mom because she is given no choice.

Last year, it came to the point where they didn't allow her to take any days off and gave her a check for the remaining paid days off instead.

Essentially they are not allowing her to take her time off and paying her for it instead without giving her a choice. I don't think this is ethical.

I would like to know if there is anything that can be done or if this is even legal. 

There is no HR department in this company, all of the issues are handled by either the manager or the vice president (who are related).
TL;DR: ", What recourse does an employee have if their employer is not allowing them to take vacation days?

POST: So my girlfriend is on a two week vacation, and I wanted to really spice things up with her when she gets back. I've been sending her provocative messages, calling her just because, and most notably I've started going to the gym again because I want her to be impressed with my super toned Bruce Wayne body.

It was going great until I hit back day and I decided to do deadlifts. I noticed a slight tightness in my lower back near my hip, but I ignored it because gains. I keep doing my sets and tightness turns into pain. But why stop, because gains. I wake up the next morning and I can barely bend over. I then was walking hunched over like an old man wondering if I should see a chiropractor.

TITLE: How do I keep my dog from running away?
POST: Fellow Bacon-lovers, I need your help.

I rescued a dog from a local shelter about 5 or 6 months ago, here he is making his [derp face]  His papers listed him as part Golden Retriever, part Australian Shepherd and he's now about 10 months old.  He settled in as a member of the family, my wife and three kids love him to death.  

Unfortunately he has a nasty habit of darting out of the door or gate if given the opportunity, even pushing past me or the kids a few times.  And when he gets out, he's gone.  He's disappeared for a couple days at a time, though I think that was mostly because the people who found him wanted to keep him.  He doesn't appear to go very far when he gets out, but we live in a pretty dense suburban area and we've never been able to find him before it gets too dark to continue looking.

He seems to have a pretty high prey instinct; he tries to chase rabbits and birds when we go on walks.  He's also highly energetic, we walk him at least once a day, sometimes more, as well as trips to the dog park as often as we can.  I've even purchased a Walky Dog bike leash for him that I've used a few times.  I'm not sure that we can commit to any more activities with him with our busy schedule.

So, has anyone else experienced this, or have any suggestions for how to keep him from running out every chance he gets?  I'm worried one of these times he'll get into a major road and get hit by a car.

We're currently considering:

* Obedience classes (expensive and I'm not convinced will solve the issue)
* Invisible dog fence (expensive)
* Shock Collar (eeesh)
* Giving him away (awwwww)

As a rule I'm against causing any harm to him, but when it's a choice between him getting hit by a car, or some Pavlovian love, I may have to break that rule.

TITLE: TIFU by telling my boyfriend I cheated on him.
POST: This happened a few months ago but another post here triggered my memory so I thought I would share.

My boyfriend is in the army and he's gone all but 4 weeks out of the year.  This type of situation is entirely new to me and I was pretty surprised when I first found myself wanting to be in a LDR.  Anyway...  

He was doing army stuff ""in the field"" (I still have no idea what that means) and was having to stay up for all hours of the night.  At this point, he had been out there about a week and was sleeping anywhere from 1-4 hours a day in small intervals.  

We texted when he had time and conversation helped keep him awake when things got boring.  The fuck up happened around 5 in the morning after he'd been fighting sleep for at least 4 hours.  He started texting me that he almost fell asleep and something about how he'd like it if I helped keep him up.  

Me, not thinking because it was 4 am where I live, had the brilliant idea of texting him, ""Lol.  I almost thought about texting you that I cheated on you or something.""  At the time, I thought that would shock him awake and we'd have a good laugh.  However, he didn't see my clearly misplaced humor and I got the lecture of a lifetime.  

""Why would you say that?!?!  I thought I'd get a funny picture or we could sext!"" was his completely understandable response.  I then spent a solid 2 hours telling him I was joking around and would rather beat myself with a sack full of feisty weasels than cheat on him.  He told a few of his friends once they woke up and they mostly (and rightfully) think I'm loonier than the Animaniacs for texting that.  I did manage to keep him awake, though.

TITLE: Best friend (25 M) had unrequited feelings for me (25 F) for a year. He moved on and now I have feelings for him.
POST: My best friend had feelings for me for over a year, which I was unaware of at the time because he never made a move. Well, I suspected a couple of times that he might have a small crush on me, but tried to avoid it due to a past relationship with a best friend ending poorly. 

Once I entered into a long term relationship with someone else, he stopped talking to me. I partially blame myself for losing contact because I was busy with a new relationship, school, and work. Also, a while later a couple of friends told me that he had feelings for me during that period and thought I knew. I didn't have much dating experience at the time and am a very friendly person (often confused for flirting) so I had a hard time recognizing subtle hints.

I ended my first long term relationship due to my SO not having certain qualities that I now realize are important to me. I am now realizing that my friend has all of those qualities, however he is in a relationship with someone else. I initially thought he was in a happy relationship and tried to keep my distance because I wanted him to be happy. However, I work with him and he occasionally describes how unhealthy his relationship is and has tried to break up with her a couple of times. We are not nearly as close as we used to be and I really miss our friendship, but can't tell if he isn't hanging out with me anymore because his GF is jealous of his female friends or if he just doesn't care to be my friend anymore. 

He has asked me for advice on his relationship, which I try to avoid commenting on because I know my opinion is biased and wouldn't want to influence his relationship.

I don't know if I should keep waiting around, if I should somehow distance myself more from him, or tell him I have feelings for him (which seems like a bad idea).

POST: I've been seeing this girl from work (restaurant, if it matters. Refer to her as C) for around two'ish months now, dating for around one. We don't tell most people from work that we're dating just to avoid problems, as some other people we work with have had issues recently and its been a real shitstorm. The people we hang out with outside of work know, as well as four or so more people.

 Its been great so far, we hang out a lot, get along, etc etc, but before we started dating, and soon after we started, one of her good friends(also works with us, so we're cool as well) mentioned that he didn't like how much she was talking to her ex. I don't know the guy, but evidently hes a real shit bag, her parents hated him, all of her friends hated him, you get the gist of it. At first, I just shrugged it off, even though it bothered me; I'm not going to tell her who she can or can't talk to, as we aren't too serious and at the moment I didn't really know where the relationship was going. 

Another coworker, N, who I trust, told me that C had been talking with one of her friends about her ex, and that friend had come to her. The friend asked if she was still talking to the ex, to which she replied, ""Well, I shouldn't..,"" the friend asked if she would be getting back together with him when he gets back in town, with the same answer. This bothers me, like a lot. Took a little while to realize how not okay I actually am with this, and just basically need some advice or insight. I'm definitely going to say something about it, and I already thought about just breaking it off.

At first, I just shrugged it off, even though it bothered me; I'm not going to tell her who she can or can't talk to, as we aren't too serious and at the moment I didn't really know where the relationship was going. 

Another coworker, N, who I trust, told me that C had been talking with one of her friends about her ex, and that friend had come to her. The friend asked if she was still talking to the ex, to which she replied, ""Well, I shouldn't..,"" the friend asked if she would be getting back together with him when he gets back in town, with the same answer. This bothers me, like a lot. Took a little while to realize how not okay I actually am with this, and just basically need some advice or insight. I'm definitely going to say something about it, and I already thought about just breaking it off.
I know this sounds like some high school he said she said shit, but the story flows a little bit better if you know the people.

TITLE: [18 M] letter to my ex [17 G] to get her back?
POST: throwaway cus friends know my reddit,

So basically me and my girlfriend of 7 months broke up a few weeks ago in a pretty messy breakup but now I want her back, I've expressed this to her and she says that for now she just wants to be friends but that her feelings towards me may change in the future. I believe there is a chance of us getting back together but whether that's just wishful thinking or not I don't know.

So we've been chatting recently and its its sorta friendly but also just how we used to talk when we were going out, really playful and jokey and I was just wondering what i could do to increase the chances of us getting back together, I might stop contact between us for a bit to see what happens but apart from that I'm not sure what to do.

I'm considering writing a letter to her in a couple more weeks basically saying that I'm sorry for what I did (i was a dick to her towards the end of the relationship, I didn't mean to it was a mistake but hey-ho) and that i hope she can give me a second chance. I can't decide whether this would be really creepy instead of romantic and whether it would just push her further away.

So yeah just sorta looking for general advice on what I can do to get her back and whether I should send the letter or not

TITLE: Question about properly logging calories burned/exercise
POST: So, stay with me here.  I put my HR monitor on and measured the amount of calories I burned while just sitting in front of the TV and it said I burned around 80 - 100 cal in an hour.  I then used my HR monitor for a half hour jog and multiplied it by 2 giving me a total of around 300 cal/hr.  If MFP already takes into account my resting calories burned to give me my daily goal, does that mean I should be subtracting my resting rate from my calories burned during a workout?  Sorry, this is harder for me to explain in writing, but essentially, if my HR monitor says I burned 300 calories in an hour, shouldn't I subtract the 100 I would have burned doing nothing (as MFP has already counted those calories burned) and only log the additional 200 calories burned?

POST: Recently I have been questioning what I should do in my relationship. We both love each other and I know she would be an amazing woman to be with for the rest of my life. But i don't know what to do about some issues that I have.

One of those issues is that I don't get to see her as often as I'd like to. We only see each other once a week for around 5-6 hours and this is the way it's practically been throughout our relationship. It has made it feel almost boring in a sense. And when we do see each other its always the same things we do every time. 

Another issue I have is that we have never have had sex. We are both virgins and the urge to experience it just keeps growing for me. But I know that she is completely fine without it. We have touched each other as well as oral but even then I don't feel like these occur as often as I'd like. We don't talk about anything sex related because it feels awkward for her.

TITLE: [19 M] I never learned any basics of romantic interaction growing up and now I'm trying to learn from the ground up. So far I've not been successful.
POST: Basically I was always awkward as a kid but later in life I came out of my shell and now I am able to function normally im society. However, where most guys had their first ""girlfriends"" and stuff in middle school, I have never dated on any level ever. As such, I have absolutely zero experience with anything remotely romantic and I have no idea how to pick up on hints, make a move, or even give/ask for phone numbers. It's all very foreign to me and I will talk to a girl and think she's pretty cool and that I'd love to talk to her more, but then that's it. I don't think to like ask her for her number or anything until I am thinking about it later and I realize how dumb I am. 

Is there any way to get better at this stuff? I know part of it is confidence, but a lot of it is also how I don't even consider romance until afterwards when I am feeling bad about myself for how lonely I am. I have had women flirt with me and me not realize it until afterwards many times and I am getting sick of just being so clueless.

TITLE: (24/f) Handling a break up with an emotional manipulator (23/m)
POST: 5 months ago, my boyfriend of two years and I broke up. We were together for two years, on and off. That was his doing. We would have a really good week, one where he was busy, one where he would ignore me, one where he would break up with me, and then the next we were back together. For two years. I'm not really sure what happened but 5 months ago I said that I was done and he agreed. We haven't talked to each other since.

Overall, I'm over him. I don't feel heartbroken. I don't feel sad. I don't cringe thinking about him with another woman. I don't care. I just still feel like ""he's around the corner"" even though he hasn't tried once to contact me. I guess I feel like he let go of our relationship so easily when he normally springs back and comes up with some excuse on why we should get back together. He emotionally manipulated and gaslighted me our entire relationship. He was extremely selfish and I took him back every time. I guess I still feel out of sorts because I'm waiting for the cycle to start again. It hasn't.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to feel like it really is done with? 5 months is the longest we haven't communicated. I know we are broken up for good. I just don't know how to shake the feeling that one day out of the blue it's just going to start up again. I know I can block and be on my merry way, but I'm referring to more of him *wanting it*. Like suddenly he's going to want me again.

I'm not really sure what happened but 5 months ago I said that I was done and he agreed. We haven't talked to each other since.

Overall, I'm over him. I don't feel heartbroken. I don't feel sad. I don't cringe thinking about him with another woman. I don't care. I just still feel like ""he's around the corner"" even though he hasn't tried once to contact me. I guess I feel like he let go of our relationship so easily when he normally springs back and comes up with some excuse on why we should get back together. He emotionally manipulated and gaslighted me our entire relationship. He was extremely selfish and I took him back every time. I guess I still feel out of sorts because I'm waiting for the cycle to start again. It hasn't.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to feel like it really is done with? 5 months is the longest we haven't communicated. I know we are broken up for good. I just don't know how to shake the feeling that one day out of the blue it's just going to start up again. I know I can block and be on my merry way, but I'm referring to more of him *wanting it*. Like suddenly he's going to want me again.

Any advice is appreciated.

I have one headphone in so I can hear if someone walks in. Someone barges in so I casually alt+tab. Only it wasn't to the desktop, it was to some porn pop up that was screaming obscenities to me which startled me not only because it was freaking loud, but also because it was a porn pop up that I didn't want my mom to see. When I jumped because of the pop up, it yanked the headphones out of my PC and my room fills with long moans and many sighing fucks. Right in front of me, my mom hears it, keeps looking forward not at me and turns and leaves...

TITLE: Boyfriend and housemates had argument, now its ruining mine and his time together, how do I solve this?
POST: Basically my boyfriend has put his foot in it a bit, said the wrong thing at the wrong time and insulted my housemates in the process (unintentionally but still.)

So last night it all blew up a bit they were asking why he said certain things and that they felt it was disrespectful as they are letting him stay here and expecting no payment towards bills etc...  He apologized, bought some wine and chocolate as a peace offering and they said it was ok but they are still a bit offended by it all as they felt he was insulting their intelligence etc..

I have said there is nothing more that can be done and to try and forget it now and go on as normal and let it blow over in its own time but him being a worrier (like myself so I do get it) is continuing to worry and letting it affect his day. I hardly see him due to it being a long distance relationship so I want to make the most of the time we have together, but he is stubborn and saying he doesn't want to do anything today and that he just wants to mope etc.. however that is making it a bit awkward for me as I have already said it will sort itself out as have my housemates, but it will take a little time to be back to normal.

Basically how do I say he needs to forget it and try and enjoy our time together and actually go out and do shit and have a good day and not let this ruin the little time we have in a way that may actually work?

POST: My wife and I have been married 5 years. We're both 25, and we both are starting to feel like different people. In a good way! But still. 

Recently we've had a bit of a rough patch, for the first time. I told her if things didn't improve we should probably get a divorce, since we owed it to ourselves to be happy. We both agreed we wouldn't give up, and try 110% to improve our relationship. So far things have gotten seriously better. BUT.

We're moving to another state, where an old mutual friend lives. We both added her on facebook and we both talk to her.

Turns out, she has changed a lot. Seriously, if she was a dude we would instantly be best friends for life. We've chatted here and there about moving, our lives and stuff, and we've been constantly having these ""what? you too?"" moments where we realize we're both into the same really obscure stuff (music, ideas about life etc). Areas where my wife and I are total opposites. I never get to talk about this kind of stuff with my wife, and I really, really enjoy it.

My wife noticed how much we talk, I'm not hiding anything we talk publicly on facebook and she has all my passwords. She said it bothered her that we talk so much, and wants me to cut off contact. I basically told her no, because we don't talk about anything inappropriate and I refuse to be controlled like that. I seriously have like no friends and this is important to me. She was upset and we're not talking right now. 

Do I find her attractive? Nope. We're honestly just friends. 

The way I see it, we either agree on this or we'll divorce, and that is just how it will have to be. I'm hoping she comes to terms with her feelings about the matter, and lets go of her jealousy.

Before we talked, I told her this was entirely hypothetical and I'm not okay with doing it, but if we were to do it, we made a set of rules and all.

POST: My (26F) gf and I (25M) have been dating for close to 6 years. The first two while we were in uni, 2 years of us basically trying to figure out life (job hunting, switching etc), and 2 years of having a lot more things figured out on the path to settlement.

For me, 2 of those years was living near campus, 2 years at home with the parents, and then 2 years away from home (1 year about an hour away from the GF, 1 year and currently a 5 hour drive from GF).

For her, she has always lived with her parents.The university was close enough that she didn't need to move out. Now, that isn't to say she isn't independent. She takes care of all the finances, shopping, housekeeping etc at home, but her parents are in good physical health to do this on their own.

So here's where the problem is. I am living quite a bit ways away, but willing to move closer back (sort of giving up a job I love, though might get laid off soon) if her and i moved in together. She'll often mention how she wants to do it and talk about what it would be like. But when I get serious about it, she always brings up how her parents would be lonely and depressed if she wasn't there. Fair enough (I argued we'd move at least an hour away from them so that the distance wouldn't be insane, but no bite)

I started at a very well established clothing store when I was 18. It started as part time for the first year because I was also going to university. After I finished my program I began full time hours at my work, got promoted to shift leader 6 months later, shortly after that I was promoted again with discussion of me eventually moving into a Store Manager role when we build new stores.

THE PRESENT:
I am 21 years old, currently assistant manager. I have been considering leaving for almost a year for many reasons and Im under a lot of pressure right now to stay. The company is expanding and we are opening two new stores in the area in May, and it is expected of me to either move up in my position or transfer/ help take on and set up the new two stores.

Now, my job isnt terrible.. all the time. Its actially pretty chill and my coworkers/staff are amazing. But for the position that I have and the amount of work, god-awful scheduling and just plain old stress I have to endure, I am not getting paid nearly what I should be. (Big company,  they dont like to pay anything if they can avoid.) 

In addition, I have just discovered my favorite store is hiring and the job is closer/pays more.

THE DILEMMA:
I have planned a 10 day long vacation for April for my SO's bday. Also I have discovered a job opening perfect for me thats closer and pays more.
So, if I leave my job now I am assuming the new job wont be happy about my upcoming vacation being so soon.

The company is expanding and we are opening two new stores in the area in May, and it is expected of me to either move up in my position or transfer/ help take on and set up the new two stores.

Now, my job isnt terrible.. all the time. Its actially pretty chill and my coworkers/staff are amazing. But for the position that I have and the amount of work, god-awful scheduling and just plain old stress I have to endure, I am not getting paid nearly what I should be. (Big company,  they dont like to pay anything if they can avoid.) 

In addition, I have just discovered my favorite store is hiring and the job is closer/pays more.

THE DILEMMA:
I have planned a 10 day long vacation for April for my SO's bday. Also I have discovered a job opening perfect for me thats closer and pays more.
So, if I leave my job now I am assuming the new job wont be happy about my upcoming vacation being so soon.
On the other hand, i don't want to pass up this opportunity and have to stay at my current job/settle for something else later on.

TITLE: Does it matter if i have a planned vacation in the near future when applying for a job?
POST: LE BACKGROUND:
I started at a very well established clothing store when I was 18. It started as part time for the first year because I was also going to university. After I finished my program I began full time hours at my work, got promoted to shift leader 6 months later, shortly after that I was promoted again with discussion of me eventually moving into a Store Manager role when we build new stores.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [21 F] of 1 year she tested positive for herpes #2 a few days ago. I'm lost.
POST: First off - this is a followup to a post that i made yesterday. That was more in anger then anything so i'm re posting this. 

The basis of the last post was that I read a chat from my GF's EX and it said that he had herpes. My GF never told me about this and never planned on telling me, she had about 2 weeks before i confronted her to tell me. I made her get tested and she tested positive for #2. The shitty part is that I dont think she had any intention of telling me. She said she never had any symptoms, so she assumed that her EX got it from his new GF.

Her ex and her haven't done anything in a year +, probably closer to 1.5 years. I honestly didn't dig too deep. They were together for 5 years. However, he has it and so does she (she assumes she gave it to him now). She said that she NEVER had an outbreak and if she had something that worried her she always went to get it swabbed. She had done this at least once in our relationship so i believe her. 

I honestly don't know what to do here, I lost my virginity to this girl at 25 because i was always so worried about STDs when i was younger. I trusted her to be clean and nope (even after testing), she wasn't. 

In the short term - I'm going to turn our current relationship into a sexless one for now. No PIV till I get tested, but i may give it another week or two to be safe. Is this a mistake? I mean, I really don't even know how i feel about this whole situation. 

Has anyone had to deal with this type of situation?

TITLE: My BF (23) has just broken up with me (23,f) after 6.5 years. Totally blindsided. We live together and have no other choice.
POST: I feel completely lost. My boyfriend and best friend of 6 and a half years has just broken up with me out of, what feels like, nowhere. 

We were high school sweethearts, went to uni together, survived all that and 6 months ago moved 400 miles away for an amazing job he got offered (UK). 

I've found a great job that I love, started to make some pretty good friends and we have an amazing house together. Everything seemed perfect and I was looking forward to this fresh start together. 

3 weeks ago he just said he didn't know how to feel any more. He'd been down for a couple of weeks but always said his job was stressing him out (he does have a pretty stressful job for a new grad).  He said he still loves me but not in the same way he used to and that things just don't 'click' any more.

I've given him space over the past few weeks but we live together and can't afford to move out and none of the friends we know here are in a position to offer either of us somewhere to stay. 

He's my best friend. I've never got on with anybody as well as him. Over the past few weeks we've been getting on really well, considering everything, and it makes me happy that he seems happier and calmer. He unfortunately bottles up his emotions for too long and can just blow/break down at times. 

I'm scared about the future. We have 6 months left on the lease of our house and moving on fills me with dread. 

I still love him with all of my heart but I understand that if that's not what he wants, I can't make those feelings come back. 

A couple of weeks ago, I went out with friends to cheer myself up, a guy ended up feeling me up in a bar and then tried to follow me home. This makes me even more depressed about the future!

I'm just looking for a bit of support really. I'm struggling to talk about this to friends and family so I'm hoping you wonderful internet people will be able to help me!

POST: I am a (19M) with my FIRST (19F) girlfriend and after three years together I feel as though I'm missing out on a lot of things. I feel as though we are married and I don't want that at all right now. She constantly talks about being married and kids and I am not ready to think about that. I fell head over heals in love with this girl sophomore year and now being in college (we attend different university's a state away) I have an urge to explore different things. 

She is a good girl and I love her very much but I'm tired of a relationship. I want to be able to depend on myself 100% for a while. I feel like an asshole when I say that but I don't know how else to say it. I've actually tried to break up with her twice but I am such a softy, I can't take her bawling and being in hysterics when I say I want to take a break or be separate. I don't have the guts to end it.

She doesn't really like my friends and we constantly fight about me going to hang out with them too much (different now that we are separated). I feel like I am her only friend. She has plenty of friends she likes but she would rather have me than all of them and I do not think the same way.

I don't know what to do right now. I catch myself thinking about being single and how I am too young to be feeling like I'm married. Being with her is all I know I feel like. I want to do me during college and figure myself out because I feel as though I will end up being less of a man than I am capable of.

TITLE: My [25M] friend [25F] started talking to me differently after recently breaking up with her [23M] boyfriend. Unsure whether she's making a move.
POST: We have been quite close before, we usually video chat when we have problems, usually relationship related. I don't know whether she's sad over her break up and just wants to  have someone to talk to, or she's making a move on me. Should note that there is <1% chance of us being in an official relationship, because we currently living in different countries, and I just broke up with someone because of distance. Here's a list of some of the things she said to me.

She broke up with her boyfriend a few days ago, and sent me a text to tell me about it. She said she was pretty sad, but she's gotten better.

I told her I recently broke up with my girlfriend myself (on good terms, we broke up because we didn't want a long distance relationship but we still care about each other), and she told me ""you can't be with one person forever"" and ""take an opportunity"". She said that since we're both sad and single, we should start talking to each other more.

She told me to use Snapchat to send her photos about ""everything"". We ended up Snapchatting whole night.

She will be in town for a couple of days then she has to travel to another country because she has things to do, and she asked me out of the blue to come with her (unsure whether she means it).

Since she will only be able to see me in a couple of days, she said she would spend all the time with me.

I'm currently at the point where I'm just there for her as a friend to help her feel less sad, I'm not showing any sign of interests or indication that I want to have a thing with her. I'm just quite bad in reading girls intentions in general. We've been friends for over 10 years, we've never been involved though I did like her 10 years ago, but she freaked out about it then and rejected me. We just laugh about it nowadays.

Girl B said Girl A said I was cute but was also confused because she likes some other guy and doesn't want to mess things up with him if she has a chance but also is just confused about me as well.  

Girl B suggested I just try and talk to Girl A but I am also confused because I am generally a shy guy and can get really awkward and have big fears of rejection.

We had talked in depth about moving to a big city, where I applied to jobs for him and set up everything so once we got jobs we would be good to go. However, he told me he would be moving only for my benefit and didn't really care much for the city I loved. 

So I said okay, we would revisit the idea in a few years. Until we moved to our current apartment, I have had a dog for the last 15 years. I love dogs and have really felt so empty not having one! I'm a responsible pet owner and am good with training, so there are no behavioral issues of any kind. 

Our current apartment is freaking awesome. It's in the non ghetto part of the city, bright and beautiful with plenty of space and the rent is low. (650 for a 3bedroom with hardwood floors!!!) 

My fiancé wants to stay here because he loves it here, and so do i, but I think daily about having a dog and am always looking for pet friendly apartments. 

He is easily stressed about money and wants to stay because of the low rent, and I keep trying to get him a higher paying job but he's clueless/lazy. He has a couple of years of direct experience and graduated from a really good uni. He also doesn't like his job and complains about it all the time.

So basically in my eyes, he has said no to a move I thought we were both on board with, and said no to finding a dog friendly place, and no to trying to better his job situation and alleviate his stress. 

I can't tell if I am asking too much and am in the wrong, or if he is just refusing to compromise with me. Who is in the wrong?

POST: 23/f and 25/m - 9 months relationship. 

Okay, I haven't been in a relationship in a while and this one has come on serious and fast. This sounds stupid but I just need to talk this out Reddit. 

Backstory: Bf and I are emotional people, I'm a talker - he tends to shut down. It makes for awkward times when one of us is upset. 

Boyfriend got mad at me the other evening because after a long day we were both grumpy yet still had a commitment in the evening. He asked for his sake if I could stay awake and happy and make the rest of the evening enjoyable. I told him I would try but I tend to completely check out when I'm absolutely exhausted. Later, he got mad that I ""couldn't be happy for him"", he just seemed to believe I was pouting and the more I tried to explain myself, the angrier he got. He finally said that he cares for me so much that if I am not fully happy, he can't be - and then he starts to resent me for it. I'm of the disposition to where my partner's mood affects me but instead of getting mad at them, I try to bring them back from it. I thought we were okay, so I started joking around (you know, light pillow talk before bed), he looked at me and just left. In the morning he drove me to work (as part of previous commitment) and seemed a hesitant to make plans, telling me he'd maybe talk to me later. We usually text during the day (but never a large amount since we see each other often) and he has been ignoring me for the past two days. Does he just need space? Am I being punished? I don't know how to handle this. I'm confused. I feel like this is a stupid thing to ignore someone over. We've had worse disagreements and have always come back to each other the day after.

POST: I am 20 and my boyfriend is 19. We have been together for a year and three months. We both go to college together and frequently visit each others families on holidays and weekends. Anyways, I need help.
   
 
When our relationship first began he was such a gentleman. He would buy me flowers and gifts. He was very eager to spend time with me and wanted to listen to all my silly stories I had to tell. Well now that we have been going out for a while I feel like things have slowed down to a halt and we are in a rut.

   He isn't a gentleman anymore. He doesn't do any of the things I have previously mentioned. There is absolutely no romance whatever, but it also seems like he has just stopped caring. When it comes to sex it is more of ""hey babe want to have sex?"" and that's it. No seduction, no sexiness, we just bang, say good game and go back to whatever it was we were doing before.  I have told him that I need a little romance and I have even given him suggestions of things to do. And every time I say these things he just kinda blows off what I say, like it goes in one ear and out the other.

   
On top of that it seems as if he doesn't even care about me or my life any more. He never wants to come over and spend time with me at my apartment. And many times he will blow me off to spend time with his friends or just to play video games. We hardly spend any quality time together. I have tried to be an example, and show him how to be romantic by leaving love notes, sending sexy texts, cooking him dinner, etc. But he never reciprocates them. Most of the time he doesn't even thank me for the things I do for him. I am not sure what to do, I feel as if I am nagging him, by repeating the same things over and over.

POST: Hello everyone. So, me 22 male and she's 21. I met her this semester on one of my classes, she came up and sat next to me and we started talking. At the beginning it was kinda weird since im pretty shy and shes really outgoing and we only met only twice a week (3 hr class and the lab) but as time passed I got really comfortable with her and we started breaking the touch barrier and flirting a bit.

As weeks passed I wanted to ask her out but me over thinking like always did not but we kept talking a lot in class and sometimes via text. Anyhow like a month ago I looked her up on facebook to add her and saw that she had a bf but had never before mentioned him. I got a bit disheartened about it but never brought the topic up with her.
Last week was our final of that class and after the test we talked a couple of minutes and I decided to go for it and asked her if she wanted to hang out this past weekend but she said that she could not  since she had other finals and had to study (last day of finals is tomorrow) but that I should call her this week to plan something up.

I talked about this to 3 of my closest friends and they pretty much agreed that if she never mentioned the bf I should just go out with her and have fun  and if she brought up the topic that I should be the one to decide on what to do, as in keep hitting on her or just become another guy friend which tbh I have no interest in. So what do you guys think?

POST: So 2 years ago, I had my heart shattered into a billion pieces by my ex-fiance. It took me a long time to get over it, but I did..

Enter this week. This girl is checking out my old ass profile on some dating website...she looks cute in her pictures, so I initiate a conversation.

We meet up for a date tonight and it wasn't bad, but i have a few issues, or hurdles I just kind of want opinions on...

*Ok, #1 thing, i'm 24...she just turned 18, and it shows. She has no life experience, is super shy...just in the way she carries herself, her mind is in a different place

2nd...I'm not really attracted to her. She's cute and stuff but I'm just not super interested in her physically or otherwise. That ""click"" just isn't there.

The date was fine. It wasn't terrible, but there wasn't exactly fireworks...

After the date, she commented on the age difference kind of bothering her, and she asked how i felt...i said, basically, since we established that we aren't looking for anything serious, that the age difference is okay with me..

She more or less agreed and we both said we'll just keep it chill, not rush anything, and just take things as they come

But i kind of feel guilty because I'm dating this girl now, and I don't really have interest in her...does that make me a bad person? Like in the past, I've been super shallow with girls and stuff...and I feel like it would be good for me to maybe just try to date outside of my comfort zone, and just try to get on my feet. But because cause she's young, maybe this isn't a great idea, you know?

I kind of feel like I'm leading her on, even though we have both been up front about not wanting anything serious. I feel like it wouldn't be right just to dismiss her based on one date just because she doesn't live up to my probably unrealistic standards.

Should i jump ship, or would it be nutso to stick around and see where things go, even though there isn't much attraction or common ground?

POST: Hi.

This is a throwaway for fairly obvious reasons. I have a ton of reddit friends, and am fairly active on /r/OkCupid. I'd like to have some privacy.

I just went on the second date with a really, really awesome guy. 

I messaged him first, asking his favorite subreddit. (I searched for users who had ""reddit"" in their profiles).

Our conversation was full of lengthy, interesting messages.

Our first date was at a brewery/pub that is quite famous locally for it's great brews.

I left totally entranced by him. I just wanted to know more. He was intriguing and interesting and interested in ME!

Anyway. I messaged him the next morning asking for a second date. He said he also had a great time, and was excited. We went to a comedy club and got fire-stone pizza afterward. 

Again, the conversation was awesome. I invited him back to my place. He hesitated and said he wanted to get to know me better before ""moving too fast"".

I was surprised, but he asked if he could kiss me (I said yes!) He did. And then we were on our way.

The next day we were texting and he said, ""I need to share something with you before our third date."" 

I was hesitant, but said okay. He said, ""I was not born male. I'm a trans guy.""

I said, ""I'm not sure what that means, but maybe we should chat about it over a pint?""

He said yes, I asked when/where, he gave me a pub and said tomorrow at 7pm. 

What the hell can I expect? I don't... I don't even know.

We haven't talked since we confrimed time/location for tomorrow.

POST: This takes place in Texas at a college town. I live in a house my mother owns with only my brother, me, and a roommate that doesn't have anything to do with this story.

The other night my older brother, his college friend 'Mark', and I were hanging out in the living room playing some games and having a good time. Seemingly out of nowhere, the front door was forcibly opened, making it slam into the wall as Mark's girlfriend came in drunk and screaming at him. Immediately, my short-haired pointer jumped off the couch next to me and was 2 seconds away from biting the intruder if I hadn't of grabbed her back leg and held on tight. My brother and Mark proceeded to kick her out and lock the door, not letting her back in. (Also, she drove here drunk, if that's relevant. It's obviously too late to call the police on that.)

Mark's girlfriend has never been to my home before and she was definitely not invited by either me, my brother, or Mark. Mark had told her where she was, but never invited her over either. She came in completely unannounced and started screaming, as she was apparently pissed at Mark for something. Understandable, my dog went into immediate attack mode, as she thought she was a threat with the girlfriend's violent reactions. Otherwise, she's the sweetest dog in the world and loves everyone. 

My question is, would I have been held liable if my dog had bitten mark's girlfriend? Obviously, Mark has broken up with her no and he has texts that say not to come over and he'll be home in a couple hours.

TITLE: Y U NO like sexy pictures??
POST: Okay, reddit.  Here's my problem.  My SO [30-m] and I [27-f] have been together for a little over a year.  I don't remember when exactly, but at some point I started sending him 'naughty' pictures.  He loved it!  I've done it around 6 times now I think, so about once every couple of months. The response became less and less enthusiastic every time.  The last time I sent some, I felt like I was being flirty and sexy and just a bit of a tease since he was out with his friends. But he didn't respond, at all.  When we spoke the next day (he got home after I was asleep), I asked him how his night went, he said it was fun and he had gotten ""distracted"" a couple of times.  Me:  ""Oh yeah..why's that?""  Him: ""Well I got this message while my phone was sitting on the table for everyone to see."" Me:  ""Oh.  I'm sorry, I hope it wasn't annoying or embarrassing."" Him: ""No, it was okay.""    Done.  I said later that it wouldn't happen again and he seemed pretty happy with that.  

So what the hell, reddit?  Why doesn't he want me doing this anymore?  I thought it was sexy and guys liked this kind of thing. 

Problem#2 that stemmed from this.  I'm having a moment of insecurity. I feel less sexy, or at least less sexy to him. But if I talk to him about this and I'm all insecure and needing to be reminded that he thinks I'm sexy, then that just makes me even less sexy because insecurity is about as far from sexy as you can get.  So what's the solution?  I need a little bit of a reminder from him that he thinks I'm hot, but I can't just tell him that's what I need without making the situation worse.   I've even found myself tempted to get this kind of reminder from one of my guy friends.

POST: Okay, reddit.  Here's my problem.  My SO [30-m] and I [27-f] have been together for a little over a year.  I don't remember when exactly, but at some point I started sending him 'naughty' pictures.  He loved it!  I've done it around 6 times now I think, so about once every couple of months. The response became less and less enthusiastic every time.  The last time I sent some, I felt like I was being flirty and sexy and just a bit of a tease since he was out with his friends. But he didn't respond, at all.  When we spoke the next day (he got home after I was asleep), I asked him how his night went, he said it was fun and he had gotten ""distracted"" a couple of times.  Me:  ""Oh yeah..why's that?""  Him: ""Well I got this message while my phone was sitting on the table for everyone to see."" Me:  ""Oh.  I'm sorry, I hope it wasn't annoying or embarrassing."" Him: ""No, it was okay.""    Done.  I said later that it wouldn't happen again and he seemed pretty happy with that.  

So what the hell, reddit?  Why doesn't he want me doing this anymore?  I thought it was sexy and guys liked this kind of thing. 

Problem#2 that stemmed from this.  I'm having a moment of insecurity. I feel less sexy, or at least less sexy to him. But if I talk to him about this and I'm all insecure and needing to be reminded that he thinks I'm sexy, then that just makes me even less sexy because insecurity is about as far from sexy as you can get.  So what's the solution?  I need a little bit of a reminder from him that he thinks I'm hot, but I can't just tell him that's what I need without making the situation worse.   I've even found myself tempted to get this kind of reminder from one of my guy friends.

TITLE: [31/m] am I an asshole for wanting to leave (29/f)
POST: I feel like a total dbag for wanting to leave my wife of 6 years. The only real reason I have is that I don't love her.

I used to be crazy about her, and I want that feeling again of being totally in love with someone, but I dont think its going to happen with her (we've tried couples therapy, reading books etc.). 

I know its not supposed to be sparks for the rest of our lives, but I did think its supposed to be enjoyable, our relationship and sex life have fizzled over time. 

I don't really find her interesting, she doesn't really have goals or feel driven to achieve anything amazing (I am driven and entrepreneurial, want to start my own business soon etc.). When we first got together she wanted to be a wife and mother, and I thought great that lines up with what I want.

With those ticked off, I kind of figured she'd have something after that, but not really. She has a job, but she complains a lot about that too, and to be quite honest she just talks and talks (a lot) and never really has a conversation with me. She gets very angry if I mention this.

She berates me for going to work events, social events, networking etc. which sucks because I love the buzz around that sort of thing.

We are civil towards each other, and can stick it out for the kids. She wants to be romanced but I dont really want to pursue her any more, which makes me feel like even more of an asshole. She's always been there for me, and supported me in a lot of ways, I feel so guilty for wanting to leave. I mentioned a trial separation once and she was furious and said that either its over or we're together.

[Also as an FYI: Part of the catalyst for me wanting to leave, is that I met a coworker about 18 months ago, and we have chemistry. Im not sure if she is in a relationship, but she drives me wild, the thought of even going out with her sets my heart racing, and Im kind of worried that I dont have that with my wife in about 3 years.]

TITLE: My boyfriend [20m] seems to have chosen his Fraternity over me [22F]
POST: We're going on 3 years dating, and it was amazing for the first 2 years. Recently there has been a lot more strain, partly because we were long distance for a while, and partly because he has been spending increasing time at his fraternity and less time hanging out with me. We usually see each other at least every other day, but he usually only wants to hang out if it's at the fraternity house.

As a 22 year old girl, I've already graduated college and work 5 full days a week. He is doing an internship and can pretty much choose his own hours, so he gets upset that I don't want to party every night. He stays up until 2 or 3 am every night, and only hangs out at his frat house. I can't convince him to go out with my friends and me, and he will rarely go to bars or apartment parties. I don't like being at the frat because I'm the oldest girl there by 3 years, and I just think it's really immature. 

I still love him a lot, but it's been ages since he's asked me to hang out in a situation that wasn't at the frat house. I try to take him places and sometimes he'll agree, but he's almost never at my apartment and the only nights we spend together at at the fraternity. He assures me that this is only because classes haven't started yet (our school starts very late) and he is making the most of summer. It's putting a huge strain on me, though, because all of my friends go out on romantic dates and I'm just stuck drinking cheap beer with underage kids in a frat house. 

He's never cheated on me, but lots of girls text him constantly and they're all over him when I'm at the frat. They know me as ""Mrs. *his name*"" so I know nothing fishy is going on, but it's still a little weird to me that he has so many girl friends.

TITLE: I[16f] found my dad[mid 50s] looking at Craigslist casual encounters. (Married to my mom for 17 years). Is he just curious?
POST: So I got back from my job and found my father asleep on the couch with his laptop open. For details, he's in his mid fifties, has been married to my mom for 17 years, and works a very demanding job in which he is gone from 6am-6pm on a good day. I wanted to tell him goodnight and I saw that the computer was open and when I went to close it I saw that it was open to a casual encounter ad that had a woman looking for a educated man around my fathers age (along with profanity and slang).
  
   I quietly backed away in shock because I didn't know how to feel. I did tell my mom and she went to talk to him after I went downstairs. I listened in and I heard him come up with a jumble of excuses including the name of a male coworker, and the fact that he was just curious. My mom then refuted this with the fact that he went directly to the ad- it wasn't totally like he was casually browsing. When she told him he would be sleeping on the couch- and he asked why- she said that his face explained it all. (Of course I couldn't see).

      What I'm asking here is if he is just curious, or if this could be a sign of something more. They haven't had any disagreements lately and he always is affectionate and loving. He does spend some extra time out after work sometimes but he says he spends it at a restaurant that he does frequent often.

POST: Some context. We are from a religious conservative family. We are close, and she tells me almost everything. She's has only had 2 boyfriends, only done kissing. Because we are close and I am significantly older we sometimes talk about sexuality.

I'm happy to see her leave the phase when she would think that boys/men in commercials and movies looked disgusting, I had sometimes thought it might be unhealthy and a result of her education by my parents. She has a childhood friend (same age) with who she as been watching romantic movies with. they literally choose what movie they will watch based on the male actors looks. 1 year ago I would think that was impossible. ""hot guy"" wasn't even in her vocabulary lol

Today she told me that her colleagues from school /same age) are going to watch 50 shades at the cinema, and that she wants to go too. I told her the movie is about BDSM, and that it is a bad representation of what is good/safe BDSM, and not about... vanilla sex. She understood my point, but said she still wanted to go and believes the ""shock"" could help change her mind regarding this things. 

After that discussion she told me to recommend her other movies that I would consider good (to watch with her childhood friend). I have no idea what movies would be those... I told her to learn about sex a film is probably not the best way, and then said we would talk later.

I hope this is the right subreddit... this is more about sexuality than managing relationships.

TITLE: My sister [15F] who knows little and is curious about sex wants to watch 50 Shades of Grey with her friends (and other sex-movies). I'm [21M]
POST: Some context. We are from a religious conservative family. We are close, and she tells me almost everything. She's has only had 2 boyfriends, only done kissing. Because we are close and I am significantly older we sometimes talk about sexuality.

I'm happy to see her leave the phase when she would think that boys/men in commercials and movies looked disgusting, I had sometimes thought it might be unhealthy and a result of her education by my parents. She has a childhood friend (same age) with who she as been watching romantic movies with. they literally choose what movie they will watch based on the male actors looks. 1 year ago I would think that was impossible. ""hot guy"" wasn't even in her vocabulary lol

Today she told me that her colleagues from school /same age) are going to watch 50 shades at the cinema, and that she wants to go too. I told her the movie is about BDSM, and that it is a bad representation of what is good/safe BDSM, and not about... vanilla sex.

TITLE: My boss killed his dog
POST: As some background: I am a 24 year old female working for a smallish, but well-known and well-regarded company where I live. What the company does is irrelevant for this post.

My boss has always been a dick. He is mean to all employees, yells when things that aren't that important are slightly off, and is a very dismissive person in general. I have never liked him, but today is the icing on the cake.

The boss often brings his older dog in to work with him. She is a sweet dog whom I pet often while working at my desk, and she loves attention. 

Today, I came in at my usual time. Shortly after I began work, the boss came in alone. I didn't think anything of it. On some level I thought to myself ""oh he didn't bring his dog in today"", but as I said I was not fazed. 

We started work at 7:30am.

3pm rolls around. He asks ""Where did *dogs name* go?""

We all reply that we haven't seen the dog all day. He jokes that maybe she has been in the car all day. After which, he goes to check his car. 

Guess who left his dog in the car all day? 

I won't get into the specifics of the temperature, but needless to say, the dog died from the heat. 

I really liked that dog. She was super sweet and nice and getting old and she was a staple of the office.

I don't know what to do I just feel so completely sick to my stomach. I hate him so much for doing that to a poor animal who totally trusted him.

What planet is he living in where he can forget his dog is with him in his car? 

I get it that sometimes accidents happen, but with all of the other awful personality traits he has I just can't even stand to be in that office. The whole day felt like an eternity. 

Really I want to quit and get out of there. Another part of me obviously thinks that that is a rash and bad idea. I don't know what to do.

POST: Happened a few years back, when I was 10 yrs or so.

I had moved to the Middle East, due to my Dad getting transferred here, and lived in a flat-type system. I only had 1 or 2 friends since no one else in the building was around my age. We all became really good friends after some time since we had some things in common.

To the actual fuck-up now. Being small, I was always curious about one thing or the other, which got the good of me.

My Dad and Mom were going out for regular shopping and all, and I decided to stay back with my friend at my place. As my Dad was in a hurry a bit, he forgot to take a 20 Dinar note he had kept in the shelf along side his wallet, he obviously took his wallet but didn't notice the note kept along side it since he was in a hurry.

Now that piece of money got me really intrigued, I always wondered what if I could get that cash and keep it all to myself! Imagine the things I could do! Me being the little 10 yr old bitch, excuse my self from my friend for a bit, and silently keep the note in my pocket. Mind you it was 20 Dinar(Bahrain's Currency), which is a lot of money.

My Dad is mostly particular about money and when he comes back, he searches for the note in the shelf. He asks my Mom if she knows where it was but to no avail. I literally turned into a pussy lol and was shivering to death inside. I didn't have the guts to spill it out. My Dad kept on thinking maybe he spent somewhere and what not but he eventually gave up.

Remember the note is still in my pants and I completely forgot about it that night and slept off. The next day, it's laundry time, my pockets are checked by Mom always because I tend to keep chocolate wrappers and whatnot in my pockets. 

Gone. Mom finds the note. Tells about it to Dad. Both call me in the living room. Got a superb lecture about it. Cried like an asshole. But hey, learnt my lesson and I haven't lied about stuff from then on. Or have I? loljk

POST: So my S.O. (30f) of 6 months and I(27m) agreed on an open relationship (my suggestion). This week I went to a music festival but did not tell her since I didn't want to have her worry that I would be hooking up with people there (its quite a wild festival). 

Once I arrive at the festival she texts me that a close friend of her has died and that she would like to see me for support. Since I lied about what I'd be doing for the weekend I just told her that I was tired and probably staying home for the weekend
 She then became angry at me that I couldn't drive 10 minutes to comfort her (Although on reality I am 4+ hours away at the festival.) 

Now I am heading back to go see her and had to leave the festival early. I still haven't told her that I was away, I feel that it would be worse to tell her the truth at this point. I.can't help but feel resentful since I had been looking forward to this festival for months now and I basically got zero enjoyment out of it since I was worried about if she was OK and also due to her sending me angry texts (Not to mention the total cost was about $400 for tickets, gear, food and transportation). I am now on the bus back and am having thoughts of just breaking it off with her although obviously now would be a bad time since her friend passed.

TITLE: [Southern CA] Copyright regarding music video I shot
POST: Around Thanksgiving I was hired to spend a week filming a band as they toured with a very well known group to create a music video for one of the songs that they performed live. The agreed upon rate was $500 which was agreed upon verbally without a contract. (it was a a referral from a good friend)

Anyways, I delivered a final cut in December and basically was met with silence from the group's management. Took me awhile to figure out what was going on; but, basically, the group members loved the video however their label did not. 

So their label went out and had them re-shoot something with some video guys (without my knowledge) and I finally saw a cut of their new version and it's awful (looks like a corporate music video). But, that's not important, what matters is that their plan is to splice my version into their version.

One of the reasons I agreed to the exceptionally low rate was for the exposure as they're gaining popularity. If they're going to create some Frankenstein mis-matched music video that completely erodes my benefits from the project.

And so, since they had not paid after ≈45 days, I emailed their manager saying that I was not okay with this and wanted to re-negotiate terms as I still own copyright on all of my material, had yet to sign anything, and have not been paid.

I'd like to make them several offers... such as allowing them to pay the original $500 and post my original video without any edits. Another would be for a significant increase in my fees if they are insistent upon combining the two videos together. And perhaps lastly, not agreeing to anything if there not willing to pay an increased amount and withholding copyright from them for violation of the agreement.

So is everything I've proposed all within my legal rights? Any suggestions? I'm not looking to be a difficult person to work with, I just do not like being taken advantage of by people with rampant egos.
TL;DR: "," What legal rights do I have in regards to the copyright of my work?

POST: Hello there, and thank you for reading this.

My boyfriend and I have been living together for most of our admittedly short relationship. We hit it off really well and both fell hard, and it turns out we have very similar interests, and similar world views. We can just talk all day and he makes me feel wonderful. I love him, and I have no doubts about wanting to spend the rest of my life with him.

 But when it comes to work,he is the one earning the money (works from home) and I clean and cook and make him cups of tea and give him massages and occasionally tie his shoes, and I'm very happy in this distribution of roles. One thing to keep in mind here is that he is physically disabled and can't always do household stuff anyway, but that is not the reason I do this.

I am not a stupid woman or a gold digger, I have a university degree and have worked full time before. But I just really enjoy the role of the demure housewife, it has greatly reduced my anxiety attack and hallucinations, I feel like a mentally healthy human being for the first time in a long time. He is never demanding, always loving, and when I feel down he even cooks for us (even if it's just pizza). 

The problem I face is the values taught to me from my upbringing. Feminism has done a great deal for women, and my mum was always insistent on me being independent from men and earning my own money. She constantly begs me to get a job and I always have to blame my mental health for not getting one, when in reality I enjoy being a housewife. But it leaves me second guessing myself - am I wasting my intelligence? Am I just lazy? Should I just go and get a job already? I also feel like I'm betraying women everywhere who fight for the right to work.

I'm (26/F) getting over a break up with someone I really loved and one of the things I've taken from it is that I want a stronger group of friends around me. I've only been in my current city for nine months, so I'm not beating myself up too much, but I've made mistakes with friends in the past and am not sure how to identify people who will be good friends. I have no trouble meeting people, but translating that into lasting friendships? So tricky.

My personal issues to overcome are 1) I'm typically not good at making friends with other women. I'm not sure why. I think I'm scared they'll reject me or we won't have anything in common. I'm trying to work on this. The second problem is 2) many people I thought were awesome friends ended up having romantic designs and weren't really the strong friends I thought they were. The final issue I've had is 3) when I find someone I really click with, I'll do all I can do be a good friend to that person, and I've often found that when push comes to shove they don't reciprocate.

Basically: I am being given control of a trust in my name this upcoming Friday. As a note I thought I was going to be given this control in a year from now, so I'm more rushed than I have intended on being when this happens. 

My parents who have control of the trust currently are sending me a list of the bullion and coins they have in a safe currently. It's not an option to keep it there due to my lack of trust in them. I am willing to spend the money necessary to transport it over, but I understand that I will need to insure it and this might be a whole process. 

I'd like to get it sent over as quickly as possible but don't want to make any egregious errors.

POST: I accidentally unchecked my custom list on Facebook, and made a post that has hurt my parents feelings. 
They've been supporting me while I study, and recently got me early Xmas present tickets to a band I've loved forever, because I couldn't afford it. 
There's a whole heap of events coming up, and I flippantly posted 'someone buy me these tickets because I'm a giant hipster and I'm poor'.
I've deleted it at their request, and I understand it was quite spoilt/entitled/insensitive of me. I really appreciate their financial help and often get really guilty about it.
They seem to think that everyone who read it will take it literally, and that it's saying that they don't support or care about me in any way. 
I think this is a misinterpretation - anyone who reads it (people my age) will know it just means 'don't have the cash flow this week'.

TITLE: I(17 m) really want to ask this girl(17 F) out, but she has a thing for another guy(17m). Please help me
POST: So about 2 months ago, I met this girl, Mary in my Biology class. We quickly hit if off and became really good friends. We have so many similar qualities, likes and beliefs. After a few weeks I started to like her and wanted to ask her out, but we both had a lot of AP testing along with work, so we had no time. 

Right after AP testing though, she went to a movie with another guy, and then she kept referring to him as a friend whenever I talked to her. I don't know what to think of that because some mutual friends of the guy and i say that they have a ""thing"".

Its now the last week of school and really the only outside contact I have of her is Facebook. I would love to ask her out but, I want to make sure its a yes before I do.

 See I have a huge problem with confidence because I'm that guy that girls continually see as a friend or reject completely. I have never ever had a girlfriend. I work out and in great shape. I always compliment every girl I talk to. One of my flaws is that I'm socially awkward. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm so sick of getting rejected that I want to make sure this one is a yes before I ask.
TL;DR: "," How well do you know Mary? 
2. Are you sure the guy Mary went to the movies with has a ""thing"" with her? 
3. Is there something you can do to boost your confidence before you ask Mary out?"

TITLE: Me [20M] and a girl [19F] I've just met, but I'm unsure about it.
POST: This is my first post on relationships so excuse anything against the rules.

So here's the story. Last month I got on well with a girl, one of my friend's mates, at a uni party, we kept in touch and my friend said that she took a bit of a liking to me. In the meantime I had developed a small degree of feelings towards one of my housemates. Last week however, I got together with this girl, nothing too serious but it confirmed my friend's suspicions that she likes me, so we went out for a drink, chatted a bit, and got on really well.  Over the past few days I've met with this girl a couple more times and I finally decided to ask if this is going anywhere serious, to which she replied ""Well we're not really going out, we're more 'seeing each other'"".  I asked my friends what this means and apparently it's more of a casual thing that we've got going. Not that she'll go sleeping around but that it's not anything too serious at the moment, but there's definitely the chance that it'll develop into that.

In the meantime the one I have feelings for has gone home for christmas, so I have a few weeks to decide on what to do. I'd love to ask her out, but I'm stuck as to what to do with the first one. I like her, but I'd be happier with the housemate. If it backfires I'm left with neither. What would be the best course of action to take on this?

Again, excuse me if I've left out any information or stuff like that, I'd appreciate any advice on the matter and if anyone needs more info I'll do my best to provide.

Thanks :-)

TITLE: How can I get rid of bad friends?
POST: I am a 23 year old female. I have known most of my friends for a very long time (since middle school). Nowadays all they do when they get together is literally sit on the floor and say awful things about other people. I used to gossip right along with them but it got me into some tight spots and I realized I'm really not into the drama. I'm trying to better myself and focus my time and energy on new hobbies and activities. I have explained to them that I don't want to contribute to their gossip, but they don't seem to want to stop. I don't want to preach at them about how gossip is bad so whenever I'm with them I just sit in silence.  We also don't really have any of the same interests. I like to browse the internet and read and do outdoorsy stuff and they like to party and go to clubs. So, in short, my friends and I have drifted apart. However, they don't seem to recognize this and are sort of clingy. I have started making new friends that have similar interests but I feel like my time is divided between these people that I want to spend time with and my old friends who(m?) I feel an obligation to. 

My real problem is that I feel uncomfortable saying no to people. I don't like to make people mad or to hurt their feelings. I find myself saying yes to hanging out with people when it is really the last thing I want to do. So, my question is, how can I learn to do this without feeling so queasy about it? How can I slowly drop my old friends? I hope I'm not coming off as selfish or conceited or anything, I am just genuinely looking for advice. Thanks for your time.

POST: This is going to be a lengthy post, so I apologize in advance. If it's not an appropriate question, please let me know and I'll remove it. Also, thank you in advance for any guidance, insight, or direction you can offer.

I started reading Reddit about a year ago after I got out of a two year relationship. I took that break up really hard, and it sucked moving out when we made a home together, but I knew that we were not a good fit. Reddit helped me rebuild myself into a better, more confident man as I reentered the dating world. After a handful of dates, I started a relationship again about six months ago. Now that relationship has ended and I'm taking it pretty hard.

I'm just afraid I'm bad at meeting women. I don't really like to go out to bars or clubs much, and I don't know where else to meet interesting women who I might be interested in, and whom will be interested in me. I'm genuinely afraid of being alone forever at this point (as illogical as that is for anyone to fear).

A little about me: I am 23. I suffer from some depression/anxiety that has gotten worse over the years and got severe after the most recent break up. I am currently in therapy getting it treated and seeing about medication next week. I am in a clinical psychology Ph.D. program. I think I'm average looking. I try to be well dressed. I ride motorcycle, cook, into classic film/literature, hit the gym ~5 days a week, bicycle, and I'm starting fencing.

I guess what I'm wondering is, where can I meet women with my busy schedule? How can I make myself more confident and attractive? I'm just feeling a bit lost and worried and I'm looking for any guidance.

POST: Currently, I work at a Goodwill Store - 30 to 35 hours per week. I receive donations and sort them into different categories. My workplace is somewhat hazardous. It's a little dusty in the production room. Sometimes, I need to climb over a half-wall to grab a wood palette and bulk box, and walk along the wall, lifting each over my head to avoid the scratching/breaking the sold furniture. My wrists hurt from carrying and throwing bags and boxes of stuff over my head into piles, in order to keep our pathways clear. My lower back is slightly sore. I have a wicked watch tan, even though I wear sunblock. So, you can imagine that the job is taking a toll on my health. 

I get along with all my co-workers, including my manager. But I'm somewhat stuck as a donation attendant here because 1) we're short-handed in donations, 2) I'm a young(er) male who can lift heavy stuff, and 3) only cashiers (off the record) have been promoted to 3rd key holder. 

I'm interviewing for a position at Target. If I get the job, they want me for the weekends, which I have no problem with, but they only offer 20 to 25 hours. So I may need to have my hours reduced at the Goodwill, or quit the Goodwill altogether - possibly severing my rapport with everyone at the Goodwill since we're already short-handed. Even if I stay with hours reduced, I can forget about any promotion.

Do I take the 20-25 hour job at Target, and risk losing (quitting) my current job. Or do I wait for a better retail opportunity? Thanks in advance.

Everything in our relationship is great but I just found out yesterday that my boyfriend is really self aware of his height and it affects him a lot to the point that he thinks I'm going to end up breaking up with him because he remembers during our friendship I mentioned I liked tall guys and that stuck with him since then.

I explained that to him but he still feels like crap and he told me is an insecurity that always affected him. 

My question is, will he still grow? His father is 180 cm and his mother is 150 cm. I read somewhere that men tend to grow until 21. He goes to the gym weekly, he is very active in general and eats healthy. Has anyone gone through the same as him? Will he grow?

POST: The elderly woman living upstairs my parents', I've heard her son yell at her numerous times, so loudly that I can sometimes hear him clearly shout ""shut up"" more than once and for her to stop bothering him. They're violent screams. Sometimes I even hear thumps, objects dropping and furniture being moved around.

I also don't want my parents to encounter any problems if he figures out we're the neighbors who did this.

She has been living upstairs way before my parents and I moved in when I was a kid. It's always been her and her son. I've never had any real contacts with her except waving to each other when she's looking out her window. We did that for years, every day when I came back from school, she was there. Then I grew up, started working full-time, got a life and would come home very late.

Just tonight, I went over to have dinner with my parents, I saw her walking to the window and looking out for the first time in years... I waved at her, but she didn't do anything. Either she didn't see me or doesn't recognize me anymore. This made me a bit sad.

TITLE: My boyfriend [M19] was diagnosed with ASPD (psychopath). Do you think he could love me [F19]?
POST: We've been going out for 2 years and we live together. The whole time I've known him, he's been very antisocial. He always stays home, never goes out. Lately he's been getting a lot of headaches. The doctor suggested he see a psychologist. After 7 sessions the psych finally managed to diagnose him and now he's being referred to someone who deals with personality disorders.

One time at a party a guy bumped into him and made some condescending comment, my bf just walked away, but he was literally twitching in anger the whole night. Often when we go on dates, he'll just come up with some random persona out of nowhere and literally act like that all night. He'll stop if I ask him to but he seems to enjoy pretending to be someone else. I thought it was just him having fun. I guess it still is, but it just seems so much more nefarious now. These things occurred to me after he told me his diagnosis.

I didn't know what it was when he told me. But we researched it together and he said that most of the symptoms seemed right. He said he used to get into trouble a lot, but he learned how to control his anger and ""read people."" He said he realized he was different early on and learned how to adapt. I have a problem with it because people with ASPD supposedly can't get close to anyone. He agreed and said that he can't get close to anyone, but I'm the exception, that he loves me. I'm not sure what to do. I want to believe that he loves me. I know that he's the same guy as he's always been, but honestly I'm a little scared of him now. I think it's a good sign that he told me what it is because people with ASPD are supposed to have trust issues, but he trusted me with this. I know that he doesn't trust anyone else though. Aggghhhhh. I need some advice.

I have always felt like a highly sexual person and find myself the 

type of person who falls for a particular person quickly and hard. It's

 not necessarily based on a sexual connection on my part, but more 

of a chemistry that I feel with these people, and it's very few,

hard for me. I am at a point in my life where I want a relationship 

with passion and chemistry, and hopefully find the person I fall in 

love with and marry. I feel like guys only want me for a sexual

 relationship and I cannot for the life of me understand why it seems

 that's all they want. I am a very committed woman, and think I bring

 a lot to a relationship, I have a big heart and care a lot about the

 people in my life. I'm confident, ambitious and I think sometimes I

 don't let the guy take the lead, but heck that shouldn't be a deal

 breaker in my opinion. The last relationship I was in was for 3 years

 and the person I was with never wanted sex, and never actually 

loved me or told me he did. It was a very, very, very strange 

relationship so I think I feel like for 3+ years I've not been loved 

very much. I also sort of have a fear of being alone, but equally a

 fear of ending up divorced. My parents never had a good 

relationship and all I want is to live a simple life, with a

fucking white picket fence, some horses, on a lake, and of course

TITLE: My girlfriend [25F] of two years asked me [30M] to pretend we're just friends at our graduation so that her religious parents don't get upset.
POST: I just graduated with my girlfriend from our graduate school, we have been together for two years and chose to go to the same post-graduate program so that we could stay together. The problem is that her parents are religious and likely won't approve of her dating me, she is worried that they may disown her. She is waiting until she has an income before she tells them.

She has met my entire family and has spent several weeks staying at my parents house, but she asked me to pretend we are not together and she asked my parents to not acknowledge that she stayed with them if we met her parents at graduation.

I was upset by this and I avoided her at graduation because I didn't want to put myself or my family in a position where we have to lie to her parents too. My brother said he would ""spill the beans"" to her parents if he met them so I didn't want that either. Now we are in a big fight because we didn't get to spend graduation together and don't have any pictures together because I choose to keep my distance and left early. 

I feel like an asshole for how upset I made her, but at the same time I feel that pretending to be just a friend when I meet her parents, after 2 years of being together, would be very disingenuous. Eventually I want to tell her parents that we have been together for a few years, I don't want to deny the last two years of our relationship and pretend we are just starting to see each other.

TITLE: Help buying plane tickets! Time-sensitive, but tight-cashed to boot!
POST: Hey /r/askreddit , I've got an issue buying plane tickets.

So I was watching the prices dip and doge all over the place with about a month to go and Bing telling me to wait a bit (With 67% certianty) that prices -could- drop.

Well, I placed a bad bet and now they're expensive and it would break my budget I set for the trip. I can still afford it, but I don't want to go over-budget and be irresponsible about this. 

Doing some more digging, I found out about Priceline's 'Name your own Price' feature - which can get you shitty flights that get you where you need to go for pretty cheap. Awesome! Flight I need at a price in-budget, what could go wrong?

The timing. That's what.

It's for my wife's birthday, and I have the time off for the day of, and a few days after. Flights I were looking at would leave after I got off work - and have me there by midnight at the latest. 

Well, Priceline's feature clearly guides you in saying that - ""At best, you can pick the day you want to leave, but for the best deal keep at least 24 hours flexible.""

I would pick Saturday, because I have the day already off - but if the flight is too late in the evening I'll miss her birthday altogether!

However, if I pick Friday, and the flight is too early, I'll miss work and upset my boss(es)!

A co-worker suggested, that I ""miss"" my flight if it's too early and go on Standby, hoping that a later flight (That I could make after work) will have seats to take me along. 

Now, this will all depend on the Airline's Standby policy (and I won't know what airline I'm on until *after* the tickets are bought) but its' worth thinking about if it can save me a few hundred bucks.

All in all, I'm pretty sure I'm screwed - but I'm not a frequent enough traveler to know all the ins and outs.

We both had an essay to complete in class, and the class being cancelled was a lifesaver as I hadn't revised for the essay. She's a bit miffed now because she can't go home yet as she has rehearsals in an hour. I've known her for a long time but we've been nothing more than casual friends. 

Anyways, I get ready to head home again and we walk together back to the common room so I can I sign out and leave. As we're walking back I joke about school and work and she's obviously enjoying the conversation. We reach the common room and turns out it's bloody empty as everybody else is either at home or in their last lesson.

Instead I just say ""right, I'm off, see you."" She responds with ""*Oh,* err... bye?""

POST: So for some context, I'm 17 and today I had to got to sixth form for the last period of the day. I head to class and I find out it's been called off because of some confusion which lead to most students heading home thinking no class was on. Well apart from me and a girl I'll call Emma here.

We both had an essay to complete in class, and the class being cancelled was a lifesaver as I hadn't revised for the essay. She's a bit miffed now because she can't go home yet as she has rehearsals in an hour. I've known her for a long time but we've been nothing more than casual friends. 

Anyways, I get ready to head home again and we walk together back to the common room so I can I sign out and leave. As we're walking back I joke about school and work and she's obviously enjoying the conversation. We reach the common room and turns out it's bloody empty as everybody else is either at home or in their last lesson.

TITLE: [Advice] Fiancé wants to stop having sex four months out from the wedding (kinda)
POST: So my (M28) fiancé (F25) told me two nights ago that although she loves our sex (which does not involve PIV. We're both virgins) she has been feeling guilty about anything that makes her orgasm. She is excited for our sex after marriage, and up until this point she's been wonderfully adventurous and engaged even though she has a lower libido than me.

She's offered to still give me oral and do whatever I still need, but she's off limits. To me, I don't enjoy sex when it's solely about me, so basically we're not going to have any sexual contact for four months.

She really wants me to stop looking at porn too, and I've been onboard giving it up for my own personal reasons, but it seems like the next few months are going to be really rough now.

I guess my only real question is if anyone has been in a similar situation? How they handled going without sex when you have an incredibly attractive SO sleeping next to you and constantly turning you on. How can I stop from blaming her when I want to support a decision that's important to her?

I don't need any advice about dumping her. I don't think we're going to have a sexless marriage based on our sexual activity up to this point. We're both pretty experienced sexually in everything outside of PIV and have had multiple partners.

POST: I say 'best friend' because I consider her my best friend but I dont know if its mutual. We dont really have the same circle of friends so when we hang out its usually just the two of us. But I met her at a party about two weeks ago and she was rather drunk and she was going on about how she loved me and how I was her best friend. Now I didnt take it too seriously because she was drunk but when I texted her the next morning to see if she was alright she signed the text off with  'I love you best friend' so maybe she was serious. The thing that confuses me though is that I feel like Im always the one initiating the texting/hanging out. Im always asking her to meet me for coffee etc. So I feel Im not really very high up on her list when shes looking for someone to meet. The other thing is when we do hang out she is usually is texting someone else, its not annoying and I dont find it rude. Its more that she texts someone and I never seem to get any texts from her. 
Am I being super needy, because sometimes I feel that I am. I try give her space but then Im worried about losing her. I just dont know how to balance it.

Anyway, I decided to do NC for the best chance for me to Move-On and for her to miss me. About 4-5 days in, she checked up on me...I ignored. This led to more contact and missed calls. I wanted to completely ignore, but I felt it would be rude. I responded amicably and short.

That was a Friday, and that night she called/texted after the bars to see me. Stupidly, I let her come over. After that mistake, I told her the next day that can't happen again. Which led to her texting a bunch and calling more. I kept it short.

Sunday, again she checked in with me to which my ignoring got her frustrated to the point of anger. I decided to call her and tell her this can't keep being a daily thing. Although it was hard and emotional, thats where things stand.

What do I make of her behaviour, did I handle it right? Did I resist too much? 

p.s. I know having her over Friday night was a mistake. It won't happen again.

TITLE: Questions and Suggestions for Credit Card count and Credit Management
POST: I have some questions as I'm considering some advice from my father about credit and credit score.  I've gone through the wiki and while it has confirmed some of the things he has taught me about the topic, I'd like to get a second opinion on the matter of credit card count.

For some basic background, I am rather stable financially, have a solid savings account to handle any kind of emergency, a solid credit score for being in my mid 20's (Mid-high 700's).  I carry only one credit card though and it has a relatively low limit from my local credit union.  I see the advantage of opening up one as it gives another line to report on long term, but I try to approach things from a practical standpoint.  I have my credit card used for only specific things and auto payments set up to pay the balance automatically, and I have not actually needed an additional card because I work hard to make sure that I keep myself in as little debt as possible so from a fiscal standpoint at the moment the issue is to me: I have enough money set aside for emergencies of most kinds that I don't NEED a credit card to handle it, so is it even worth getting a second one?

I'm aware too that I could ask for an increase increase in the limit on my existing card and likely get it with no problem, but then I would want to approach the situation with the mindset of: one card is for general use like I am already doing with specific kinds of purchases, and the other would be there for something bigger, like some large piece of furniture and the like, to which I again cannot forsee anything at the moment where I would want to put down $1000+ on something all at once.

TITLE: Favourite dry seasoning mixes for rice? Or maybe veggies?
POST: I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant with my second child and working to create a menu of pre-made freezer or easy-prep recipes to get us through the most difficult first 4-6 weeks.

I'm pretty good at main-dish items for the freezer, but I'm not so good at veggies and rice. I have a toddler with the usual toddler particularities and she won't eat bland foods. I try to avoid sauces as much as possible and just adding chicken broth is still too plain for her.  Ideally, I'd like to find a couple of herb or seasoning blends that I could just add with rice and maybe butter to make it taste better. Sort of like a box of Uncle Ben's style rice, but not at $3 per meal. If anyone knows something similar that works with veggies, I would appreciate that, too.

I have a wide selection of dried herbs available, all the common ones used in Italian, English, French, and Spanish recipes, plus a few spices like Cinnamon and Nutmeg used in baking. Nothing really ""hot"" except curry powder.

TITLE: I'm in a weird situation with the car dealership
POST: I bought an 06 scion xb from a dealership in my town. A month into having it, the dealership calls me regarding a title issue. Apparently the previous owner put an estimated amount of miles on the title when he signed it over and the auction didn't catch it. When the dealership bought it, they didn't catch it either.  It wasn't until they tried signing it to me that it was noticed and now the true miles are ""unknown"". This puts a red flag on my Carfax and makes my title a box c. Ultimately the value of my car dropped and I can't trade it to a dealer because banks won't finance a dirty title.

They offered me my down payment plus the money I put it in it. Or I can keep it knowing that in the future, it's going to harder to sell.

Of course I asked for my money back, but they were not happy with that. This particular dealership has five lots in my town so the GA drove from one of the other lots to this one to try and get me out of taking my money back. He offered me cars at the same price(literally driving me to every one of their lots), or cheaper ones I could pay in full with the amount of money I put down. I was consistent with wanting my money back. He got real pissed, made some phone calls, and ended with the idea that they would be allowed to pay me 1,505. Thats 15 cents per mile I drove it plus a $195 detailing ignoring the 380 I put into it at the shop. My down payment was 2,000. I told them to keep the check for now. I wanted to talk to the owner.

Now everyone's avoiding me.

What can I do about this if they refuse to give me all of my money back?
I feel like this isn't my fault and I should be compensated for the devaluing of my car that was done on their part.

TITLE: What are your best ""I called out a shitty employee"" stories?
POST: Years ago a friend and I used to go to a Kerby's Koney Island probably 4 times a week for lunch while working, did this all summer long (worked at a golf course).  One night after work we ended up there and took some seats (seat yourself when its not busy). 

In 15 minutes (we watched the clock after 5) one waitress had walked by us 4 times to get to other customers and another had walked by us twice.  We finally got up and just started to walk out.  As we were heading out, one of the waitresses said ""Why are you leaving?""  I turned around and just said ""We sat there for 15 minutes and no one came to take our order.""  

I turn around to leave and hear it behind me, in that snarky ass tone from one of them.. ""Well I don't know about you girl, but I never saw them.""  I stopped.  Then I hear it from the other one, ""Yeah, they couldn't have been here long.""  I turn around. 

I walk up to the counter and basically start screaming while pointing at them ""Don't you dare fucking lie like that, you walked by me twice and you walked by me four times, one time you even smiled at me.  So don't you fucking stand there and lie saying that you didn't notice us.""  Then I walked out. 

Still went to lunch there the next day, I mentioned I had crappy service at night to my waitress and she had actually heard about some raving lunatic that came in and yelled at a couple of the waitresses the night before.

So a couple months ago my SO asked me to go to a wedding with him, and of course I agreed. His family lives pretty far away, so I haven' gotten a chance to meet them yet, and we have to go back to his home town for this wedding, which is a very small town. 

I went shopping about a month ago for a dress, and he couldn't come with because he was working, and because I'm a university student, I don't have a lot of money, so my mother came with me to help pay.

its all fine and dandy, until my SO finally showed me pictures of the last wedding his family had... the pictures consisted of people wearing jeans (some in nice pants) and people in t-shirts!!!!! To top it all off, apparently he sent his mom a picture of me in the dress, and he told me that she ""said it was nice"" she actually told him that it was ""very possibly fancier then the wedding dress""

So a couple months ago my SO asked me to go to a wedding with him, and of course I agreed. His family lives pretty far away, so I haven' gotten a chance to meet them yet, and we have to go back to his home town for this wedding, which is a very small town. 

I went shopping about a month ago for a dress, and he couldn't come with because he was working, and because I'm a university student, I don't have a lot of money, so my mother came with me to help pay.

TITLE: Me [30F] Crushing on someone [32?F] who is in a rocky relationship
POST: Met this friend of a friend a few months ago and immediately had a crush on her.  I then found out she had a girlfriend, but after hanging out with them it was very apparent they were on the rocks.  Put her in the back of my mind until abouta month or so later when I hung out with her again with a group of people.   Apparently they HAD broken up, but they had just recently gotten back together.  -___-

All I ever hear from mutual friends is that they just argue all the time and they should break up.  However I think she is currently in that rosy reconnection phase when you get back together with an ex.

I don't know what to do - just continue to hang out with her, or avoid her?  If she was in a good, happy relationship I wouldn't even think about her.  But it just seems like it's inevitably going to end.

I am NOT going to try to be a home wrecker, but I kind of want to be there if she does break up.  Who knows how long that could take though.

Does this ever work out??  Has anyone started to like someone in the trailling end of a bad relationship and had it work out?  I'm certainly planning on dating other people (OKCupid and such) in the meantime and not wait around for her, but I really like her.  It sucks :(    

I guess I'm looking for evidence that it could work, then I can forget about it momentarily and just do my thing and maybe the timing will be better in the future.  The thought of totally ditching my feelings for her seems sad and unnecessary.

I'm glad to see that you've decided to give me a chance. Look- we need to talk. I haven't had time until now to look at Reddit, and I can't believe some of the things you (the community) have upvoted into the highest ranks. Posts talking about how single people will be doing *nothing* but masturbating and crying.

I am not single. There are many people who browse this website who are. I can understand if you want to lighten the mood a bit, but can you be more just a *little* more considerate about the feelings that people have about a day celebrating not being lonely, please?

This is not a plea to ""forever-alone'ers"". This is to speak to the user who sits alone tonight of any gender or sexual preference and is forced to endure all these things that are telling them that they should feel bad today. It really makes me sick, guys.

I know what it's like to be down like that- and if I was down like I was years ago, then, well- I'm not sure if I'd be able to look at you (the community) as being a supporter of my efforts. Please don't help to make some members feel that way.

I want the sad people to know that ANYTHING can come with time- just please for me, an anonymous guy, try to believe me. I may not know your hurt, but I know the feel. Just give yourself some time. It may be rough, but things WILL get better if you continue on.

I want the people who have supported such offending content to be more cautious. I don't want our community to be anything but stronger, so please- try to be more sensitive about Valentines day, and as the holiday comes to a close, more sensitive long term.

TITLE: Me [27 M] coming back to my [21 F] wife after a 10 month deployment. Currently scared shitless.
POST: A bit of backstory: My wife and I have been together for 2 years, but because we were both in the Navy, we have been able to spend probably a grand total of 6 months actually TOGETHER. I love this girl more than anything, but I'm running into a pretty big problem-

I'm currently very close to being home after being gone for almost a year overseas. Over that time my wife and I have stayed in daily contact, but things haven't always been peaches and cream.

We're both depressives, and I have pretty severe trust issues that I try to keep in check, but when things come up, I can tell they hurt her, and it kills me when these things happen, so I've been trying to keep myself busy to avoid getting wrapped up over her and obsessing, but as a result she now thinks of me as ""a pen pal"" and is emotionally distant with me, which fucking hurts. This causes more problems, and now we have steadily been fighting more and more over mundane shit. 

In the past week we've been keeping things friendly, but the hurt still very much runs deep in both of us. Add to this the stress from being out to sea forEVER and dealing with the worst bosses I've ever had and I am an emotional wreck.

Now I feel like coming home is the only hope of our salvation I have, but she doesn't seem as excited as I'd hoped about me coming home (which is understandable. She spent the last week at finals and preparing our new home) and I'm not confident that just plopping my depressed, half-crazed ass into her life after a year away is going to do anything but make us both incredibly sad. 

Now instead of looking forward to a beautiful reunion, I'm dreading having to confront what could be a devastating reality. I love my wife more than anything in the world, but I'm terrified that we may have grown apart.

TITLE: [17M/17F, 1 year] How to handle my girlfriend's depression?
POST: Hi /r/relationships, my girlfriend of one year has recently been ""officially"" diagnosed with depression. She says it makes her very apathetic towards everyone and everything a lot of the time. Now, I care about this girl very much, but it's hard to do that when the other person doesn't seem to care at all. 

Am I asking for too much if I just want the occasional text, for example? We used to send each other walls of text all the time, now I always initiate conversations and she's much less loquacious to say the least. A lot of times now when I try to kiss her she gives me the cheek or just a quick peck. When I go see her during breaks in school she barely pays attention to me and talks to other people. But then when I walk her home at night on the weekends we always talk a whole bunch, sometimes just like we used to, and she confides in me. I'm the only one in our circle of friends who knows about what she's going through. 

It's very confusing for me. I want to understand her and be there for her but I feel like it's also unfair towards me that she makes me feel unwanted. I just want a minimum amount of effort to show that she cares.

Am I not reacting right to this? What should I do? :/
TL;DR: "," What kind of support does your girlfriend need to manage her depression?

TITLE: Help me, Reddit! Should I stay or should I go?
POST: I am 22(f) and he is 27(m) almost 28. Lets call him X.
X and I have been dating for three years. We both come from families with an average income.

Right now I am finishing up at college, but am going to grad school near my hometown (which happens to also be where X lives) for numerous reasons. I am probably one of the most ambitious people I know. I am really set on setting myself up to be successful in the future, and so far, everything is going according to plan for me. I have the connections I need for my chosen field and was even promised a job at my desired work location upon my graduation.

Whats the problem, you ask? He is one of the least ambitious people I have ever met in my entire life. He has a minimal pay job that is unreliable and is living paycheck to paycheck. Absolutely nothing has changed with his situation in the last three years. Yes, there were a few failed attempts at a slightly better job then what he is doing now. But as I said, these were FAILED attempts.

When X and I first met, it was all fun and games. I had no idea what I wanted from my future so I wasn't really concerned about him not really doing anything all day everyday. But now that I am beginning to think about a career. I am much younger then X and I am getting started on this NOW. It hurts because I see that he might not be headed in the same direction as I am. This sucks. I love everything about him. Minus this one aspect, which unfortunately is important, our relationship is flawless. We NEVER fight (I can think of only one major argument throughout our relationship).

POST: Met a girl online, we've been talking for about six months.  We live a few states apart, and we first met each other three months ago, and everything was great.  We have talked about a future together, and we have called each other bf/gf in the past.  

However, starting about a month ago, she hasn't been texting/calling/Skyping me as often as usual, or she'll say she's going to call me but doesn't.  

Yesterday, she told me she was going to call me in about an hour.  Well, five hours later, she still hadn't called me.  So I called her, and her phone was turned off.  I tried calling her again this morning--still no answer.  However, about an hour later, she sent me the following text message:  
""I'm sorry I didn't call you, I fell asleep. But you need to understand that a long distance relationship isn't like a normal relationship.  It's pretty much a 'when there's time for it' thing, or something like a friends with benefits.  You need to start thinking about this relationship like that so you don't get hurt.""

Then she called me later in the day and we continued to talk as we always have in the past, including planning our next visit in a couple of months.  

At first I didn't think much of what she said, but now I'm confused.  How can an LDR be a FWB situation--what are the benefits when I only get to see her every six months or so?  Should I stop wasting time, money and effort on this relationship, if you can even call it that? I wonder if this is her way of wanting to end things?  (Note:  Just last week she was talking about how maybe down the road we will be living near each other or even together).

POST: Been dating almost 3 years now. We spend most of our time together, and most, it not all, of our friends are mutual. We each attend two separate nearby colleges, and have very long term plans at the moment. 

We're two very different people, and I always felt that was one of the things that makes our relationship work so well - we complement each other. I'm a Computer Science major who loves his video games and tech toys, and she's an English major who writes literature, makes art, and loves fashion. Everything I can't do, she can, and vice versa. I feel we connect on an emotional level, and I feel a comfort and acceptance from her I can't describe.

But herein lies the problem. I feel like we've become stuck in a rut and run out of things to do. The only activity we have in common is watching movies and TV shows, and sometimes I feel like that's not enough. Sitting around and talking about your day can only get you so far, too. We know absolutely everything there is to know about each other - and, while that does bring some comfort with it, it also leaves us with nothing to talk about.

I've brought this up to her, asking her if she'd be interested in picking up a hobby we could both enjoy and do together. After hours of brainstorming, we had nothing besides taking walks together - something I still feel isn't enough. Am I expecting too much from this relationship?

POST: So first of, thanks for the read. It al starts with this girl I've been friends with since almost 8 years. We really didn't try things since we were always at different realtionships, but starting this year I kissed her and things changed between us and we couldn't deny there was always something.

 Fast forward November, I don't really keep much contact between my exes but my last one decides to call me and we end up chatting a little ( nothing serious mostly just music) and she ends up posting a song I recommended her on her fb. Just to clear things up my friend and her aren't even friends and never were. So next day I end up seeming my friend pretty pissed about something (which happened to be the song I recommended and she happened to assume that I did recommend it to her, which in this case she was right) she got angry with me and lasted a few days like that. But she never told me the reason why, so I had to find out through some other friends.

We eventually ended up together again but last week the same thing happened and I since then haven't even had contact with my ex since I knew how things ended. I really care for my friend and I wish she could be the one. But things are starting to get pretty fucked up if she's gonna go stalking my ex and assume everything she posts is something about me or it was either a song or movie I didn't recommend.

 I tried telling her the truth but she is very angry and I can't figure what to do. She said she wasn't even gonna mention it and that she would be ok in a couple of hours after seeing that. But here's where I wonder if somehow I was also wrong by trying not to clear things up and do all the explaining, since I hate this kind of drama and want to avoid it from happening again.

But, good lord, the guy has zero initiative. 

He just wants to follow me around and do whatever I want to do. That's fine for a day or two, but over the course of a week-long international visit I start to despise him and just want to have my space and time to myself, instead of constantly having to host and entertain someone who comes up with no ideas for stuff to do, and has no desire to go do anything on their own. 

When I visit distant places (including his city), I have a huge list of stuff I want to do, both on my own and with others. I throw out the option of following my hosts' plan, or entertaining myself, or bringing my host along on the stuff I've planned. I have ideas and try to be flexible, is what I'm saying. He's not me, and that's ok, but I've got to figure out a way to deal with him without resorting to murder.

I've tried directly asking him to come up with stuff to do, or find things for himself to do. No success. I just don't think it's part of how he approaches the world.

So, how do I survive the week without starting to hate my old friend?

TITLE: Me [19] and my parents have started fighting a lot, its causing me a lot of stress and I'm worried I can't handle school due to it
POST: When I was seventeen my parents and I would fight three or four nights in a week. These were huge arguments, screaming, they often got close to hitting me at points. Sometimes they would end in me being told ""You're guaranteed to off yourself before you're 20, get it over with and save everyone the trouble.""

Things have repaired since then. I've recovered my grades since that time and we stopped fighting. I started volunteering, got a part time job, and started majoring in engineering at my local school.

Now I'm living with them until I change schools in September. I don't have the finances to move out, and feel like its almost pointless when I'm so close to leaving the city.
Problem is that because I'm in school from 6:00-22:00, and working all weekend, I haven't been able to do dishes, clean the house, or make dinners (I don't even eat at home). This causes a lot of friction, and now I don't have time to sleep between the fights, am stressed out, and feel like I'm going back to the depression I had two years ago.

This summer i'll be living with them and working a couple part time jobs before moving. I literally can't handle this fighting. But if I tell them that they'll think I'm ungrateful and lazy, therefore requiring discipline. How do I get across that I need space and support rather than this constant negativity?

TITLE: [23F] Having trouble connecting.
POST: So I guess I'm just wondering if what I am currently going through is normal for most people in their early 20's or if there is something wrong with me.  

I move yearly for my job.  It's a bit difficult because I have a very hard time connecting with people.  I can probably count my friends on one hand.  Does it typically take more than a year for people to develop a friendship?

Moreover, I'm not really interested in becoming friends with anyone I work with...but thinking that makes me feel like an asshole...but at the same time, I'm usually a good judge of people from just a couple interactions... and they all seem very different from me.  Whenever I get invited out, I find myself waiting for a good moment for me to slip away so I can go home.  Or standing awkwardly in the corner listening to someone's conversation.

I also don't have a significant other, and have only ever dated one person (over a year ago)...I can't say I was super in love with them...but being in a relationship was interesting and different so I stuck with it for a while... I haven't really sought another relationship since then, because it just seems like a hassle...

At the same time, I get lonely and wish I had someone around whom I could hang out and laugh and be comfortable with like I do when I'm hanging out with my best friend (whose a hundred miles away)... and I feel like I'm wasting my life locked up in my room... but at the same time, it takes so much energy to go out and try to socialize...

TITLE: Me (27/F) developing feelings for a co-worker (26/M) during rough times with my boyfriend (29/M) and unsure what to do
POST: Me and my boyfriend (9 months) used to have a great relationship, however things changed about a month ago when we had our first argument and hit a rough patch. 

This also happened to be the same time that I began working with a new co-worker, who I got along great with. He was single but not looking for anything, and I was very happy with my boyfriend until that point and so hadn't even considered anyone else in a very long time (we were friends beforehand too). My new co-worker was great at cheering me up when I was feeling down about how things were going and managed to always be there for me - though I know that that's an unfair comparison because he of course sees me more or less every day whilst my boyfriend does not.

Over the last couple of days it's become clear to me that I'm beginning to develop feelings for my co-worker, and I know that he feels the same way. As for my boyfriend, we worked through the rough patch, for the most part, but parts of it definitely still linger. A particular tipping point is that I did break up with him shortly after the initial incident happened, but we both realised neither of us wanted that and decided we would try again - plus to his credit he has really listened to everything I had to say and has been working hard on improving the areas I mentioned, as have I.

I'm not sure what to do now - I've never been in a situation like this before. I can't deny that I have definite feelings for my co-worker, but I was also always completely happy with my boyfriend until this happened. I am not sure whether it would be better to spend more time or less time with him, and of course my co-worker has an advantage in that he seems me all the time. Normally I would distance myself from the other person, but in this case we are two of four people working on a project so that is not an option at all.

I have to tell you that normally I would avoid the awkwardness and let her go down.(Hey she made her way up on her own) but since I was training I had to suck it up and ask her dad if she was ok to make the 10 feet swim without his help.

My girlfriend now works 2pm-11pm Monday-Friday. I work 6am-4pm Monday-Thursday, so we can only really see each other briefly Thursday night, briefly Friday morning, and on Saturday and Sundays... The last year we spent 95% of our days together because we had matching work schedules.

So... I now feel far removed from my best friend... and it sucks, it's surprisingly comparable to what I imagine withdrawal symptoms would feel like for someone quitting an addiction. Before her work schedule changed I thought it would be easier to adjust than this.

I guess what I'm looking for is some feedback from people who've been through similar situations. How did you cope at first? What made things better, what made things worse? I should clarify that we don't live together but are planning on moving together later this year (probably summer)

POST: I have a crappy part time retail job that I am glad to have after being unemployed for months. Now they are ~~asking~~ requiring every employee to submit a bio of our ""passion"" (it's a sporting goods store, so sports or outdoor activities only). This bio includes two pictures, one of us doing our ""passion"" and one profile picture taken in the store by a cashier. Then they make it into a poster and put it on the sales floor. Thing is, I am a *very* private person and think I should have the right to opt out of this. I have only worked there a couple of months and don't want to get on the management's bad side or worse, get fired. So what do you think? If I reject their request will they fire me? Or should I just submit a total bullshit bio and go home and cry underneath my coffee table after every shift?

POST: Ok, so I just started grad school about a month ago and am getting my PhD.  I came into the program with 3 girls and all 4 of us get along really well.  I have great rapport with all of them and we all hang out together most days of the week because we have the same classes/lab/etc.  We also go out and do fun things on the weekends together as well.

Hanging out with these girls all the time, it was only a matter of time before I started having feelings for one of them.  She is totally my type and I think we would be a good couple but there are multiple problems.  First of all, because of our ""group"" and the fact that we're all going to be together for the next 4 to 5 years, I don't even know if it is smart to get involved with any of them... Secondly, she has a boyfriend of 6 six years that (as of recently) now lives two hours away.  They've kinda been on again, off again for the last couple of months with the uncertainty of the distance, but she seems very much into him still.  

So, reddit, what do I do? I'm thinking I should just bide my time, hope the distance is too much and they break up while exploring other options.... but still not totally sure.

Also, worth noting, I just got out of a 2.5 year relationship 6 weeks ago (first big love/relationship) and am still getting over it.

TITLE: 230 to 175 [M; 26; 5'11''] Took me 4 yrs but I did it. You can do it also!
POST: Been a lurker on the loseit subreddit for a few months now. I really enjoy reading inspiring stories of people who lost a lot of weight and have kept it off. I just wanted to share my story to those seeking motivation. This is my first post on reddit ever so I hope I did everything right.

During my senior year of college, I weighed my heaviest at 230 lbs. From eating unhealthy to late night frat parties, I was destroying myself but didn't really care.  I tried 4 years on and off to lose weight with some success but would gain it right back. 

I started a new job in 2010 and my weight stayed in the range of 195 - 205 due to constant work travel and late work nights. In March 2012, my twin brother (who was the fit one in the family) forced me to make a promise to run the Disney World 2013 Half-Marathon with him. I had never ran more than a 5K in my life. 13.1 miles seemed daunting.

With a promise made and his motivation, I set up a running program and made myself run (I also did cross-training on my rest days). I swore off fast food and soft drinks (I can't even drink them now because they are too sweet for me!). I started to do my research on what foods to eat and started cooking my own food more. The pounds started coming off within a few weeks and months. My goal was to run and finish with my brother. 

I hit my goal weight of 175 in May 2012. Much earlier than I thought but I maintained my fitness goal and weight and ran the Disney World Half-Marathon with him last month. I almost cried when I crossed the line with him as it was a close of a chapter in my life that I had struggled with since college.

Now, my goal this year is to run my first marathon and to do the Goofy Challenge with my brother in 2014 (39.3 miles in two days). I am also trying to gain more lean muscle mass for myself.

Everything is usually fine and smooth but as of late my mom has been up our asses about hanging out in the same bed when anyone else who lives in the home is around. Specifically my brother

I know she's probably thinking about how awkward the situation is for him but what she may not know is he's sexually active with his girlfriend and not totally naive to what me and my gf would be doing living in the same house.

TITLE: I [24F] do not know how to set boundaries appropriately?
POST: Hello, world of Reddit. This is my first post here so please bear with me if anything is out of place.

I know for a fact that I struggle with social situations.

A little background. I'm 24, I am a senior psychology undergraduate student. And yes, I am going into the mental health field. My friends often come to me for advice, consolation, and the like, which I don't mind, and in fact, I love giving advice when I have the emotional energy to help.

I've been recently finding myself in situations where I feel taken advantage of: where neither my humanity, my needs, nor my obligations are observed, and that I am expected to be either the fixer or the problem-solver whenever other people need. I kind of feel as if I am treated as someone who does not actually have these functions.

And in some cases, I feel many relationships become imbalanced or where the only aspect of the relationship is listening to problems; never low key things like playing video games together, bonding over pizza, or taking a walk in the sunshine. Or watching Netflix together. Or hanging out in the same room, quietly, doing my own thing with someone else there if something needs to be said. Talking about the universe!?! Or even just about how a crazy day went.

I know I've always had a problem with setting boundaries because my automatic assumption is that others mean well and that I should be patient with them, though clearly that is not always the case. Some people have strictly used me to vent – basically not valuing me outside of the benefit that I'm a person they come to to fix things.

I don't know what boundaries I need to set, or how to make them known, so I don't end up in dynamics that end up being one-sided and not fulfilling at best, toxic at worst.

I like helping people, this includes listening to them when I have a bad day, but how do I make the distinction to others and draw the line between what's acceptable and what's not?

I would appreciate constructive feedback on how to improve my life for the better.

TITLE: Had a one night stand with my roommate now things are awkward. I need help.
POST: Ok, full details: We've been living close to a year together now, she's 27 i'm 24. She had a boyfriend until pretty recently but since he moved away she's been single for a couple of months, although i am pretty sure she means to start dating a mutual friend of ours. I have had some girls over, some repeats but never more than 2 or 3 times per girl, my roommate is aware that I have had girls over and that most of them only stay one night. One last bit of background, we had definitely broken the touch barrier before, we sometimes scratch each others backs or give foot massages and back rubs.

The event happened as follows:

It was Friday night and we decided not to go out, a friend of mine had arrived in town and was staying the night. We each had a couple of cans of beer and started to watch a movie. Both me and my roommate fell asleep on one couch (couch is pretty big, we can fit 2 deep easily) and after a while my friend fell asleep in the other couch. I woke up to the bathroom and then coming back ended up with one of my hands on her tummy, (didn't really mean anything sexual) after a while she moved her hand to my my thigh and started rubbing. After a while of mutual rubbing she move my hand to her breasts and grabbed my crotch. To cut it short, we decided to move to my room and had sex twice (this might or might not be important, the second time we did it without a condom, she had a morning after pill afterwards.).

We've spoken since, but not about that night, and we have been seeing each other very little lately, she seems to be spending a large amount of time outside of the house during the time i am usually in. There has been some more touching but nothing sexual and there is a certain atmosphere in the air. I just want to have things back the way they were, she is a kickass roommate and the place is fantastic.

POST: So today we had an important final board exam. It's our Physics IGCSE. This one guy is really terrible at academics and we all make fun of him. Today he shows up 10 minutes before we go into the exam hall, having barely studied. He asks us, the other guys, what the formula is to find the gradient of a graph. This one guy sarcastically gives him a different formula. We all laugh and go along with it. 

Well, in the exam, they ask us this question based on the gradient of the graph. I answer it and move on. I go home after finishing the exam. Normally, us guys hang out after the exam and discuss the papers. The guy I mentioned doesn't join us usually, because the school thinks he has a learning problem, and so he gets 1.5 times as much time to write the exams as us. (I don't think he actually has a disability. He just doesn't concentrate in class and puts a bare minimum of effort into studying.) 

I go home and all seems right in the world. Except, a few hours later, I get a message from a friend who was with us when we told the dumb guy the wrong formula. He tells me that that guy used the formula we gave him, costing him (at least) 2 marks. We're still figuring out how to come clean and make up for it.

TITLE: Using PRBC for FICO expansion, and other thoughts about having no credit.
POST: My husband (30M) and I (26F) are new to credit (we both have none), and just purchased a new car with some very gracious financial assistance from family members (who we will be paying back over the next few years).

Now we are on track to begin building credit, and in the meantime, we have both started using PRBC online to build an alternate line of credit, hoping that it might be usable for a FICO expansion score in the future for loans and possibly for our current credit card application, in case we are not approved.

I'm wondering if anyone has used or is using PRBC, and if so, have you had a good experience with them? Apparently their website is still in beta (how has it taken this many years for them to go online?!) and I am having a rough time getting my account going and reasonably useable.

My husband had no issue creating and verifying his account, but when I tried to create mine, it wouldn't accept it, saying that they could not verify my ssn. I realized that I had entered my birthday wrong, so I tried again and it still gave me the error on the ssn. After backing up my identity with tax documents, customer support seemed to indicate that it was a site error and that they would resolve it by the end of today. They still haven't fixed it, but I was able to get into my account somehow and add new personal information. However, if I try to go to my main page it pulls up the application window that discredits my ssn. At this point I'm worried about identity theft.

With that problem, along with the problems that go along with the site being in beta, I've been questioning the legitimacy of the company. They are, as best I can tell, federally recognized as a reporting agency, but man they aren't coming across that way. I'm hoping someone here can ease my worry and anxiety a bit about PRBC.

POST: My husband (30M) and I (26F) are new to credit (we both have none), and just purchased a new car with some very gracious financial assistance from family members (who we will be paying back over the next few years).

Now we are on track to begin building credit, and in the meantime, we have both started using PRBC online to build an alternate line of credit, hoping that it might be usable for a FICO expansion score in the future for loans and possibly for our current credit card application, in case we are not approved.

I'm wondering if anyone has used or is using PRBC, and if so, have you had a good experience with them? Apparently their website is still in beta (how has it taken this many years for them to go online?!) and I am having a rough time getting my account going and reasonably useable.

My husband had no issue creating and verifying his account, but when I tried to create mine, it wouldn't accept it, saying that they could not verify my ssn. I realized that I had entered my birthday wrong, so I tried again and it still gave me the error on the ssn. After backing up my identity with tax documents, customer support seemed to indicate that it was a site error and that they would resolve it by the end of today. They still haven't fixed it, but I was able to get into my account somehow and add new personal information. However, if I try to go to my main page it pulls up the application window that discredits my ssn. At this point I'm worried about identity theft.

With that problem, along with the problems that go along with the site being in beta, I've been questioning the legitimacy of the company. They are, as best I can tell, federally recognized as a reporting agency, but man they aren't coming across that way. I'm hoping someone here can ease my worry and anxiety a bit about PRBC.
TL;DR: ", Are there any potential risks in using PRBC for identity verification

TITLE: Me [21 M] having trouble getting over ex [20 F] even though its been a over 7 months.
POST: Hey everyone, I broke up with my ex about about 7 months ago or so, I struggled with it terribly for the first few months, don't want to go into detail but it was bad.

Anyways after about 4 months I finally started to move on and stopped caring eventually. I hardly thought about her anymore, or at least not a quarter as much as I used to. But recently I've fixed my old PC that I had when I was still with her and I forgot my hard drive had all of my old journal entries about her and old pictures and reminders of things we did together and suddenly my heart started pounding and I felt miserable all over again, it felt like we just broke up again and I could hardly breathe.

I dont look up anything about her, I havent talked to her in months. I hadnt even seen a picture of her for about 6 months before I turned on my old PC, but I'm apparently still struggling with it whether I realize it or not. She wasn't a nice person and we had a terrible relationship for the last few months, she made me miserable but I still have lingering feelings and I have NO IDEA why.

Since we broke up I got a job, started going to school again, got a few girls numbers and finally started flirting and talking to women after waiting for months. I have regained a social life.

What can I do to make these shit feelings go away? Some of my friends told me it took years for them to get over girls and that just terrifys me, I hate thinking about her and it hurts badly. I know there aren't shortcuts but I thought doing what I'm doing now would help and it just seems like it hasn't. Please help me.

So anyway they left but before they did we traded numbers (and last names too so we can find each other on facebook)

So the question is what do I do now! I like her, and I'd like to get to know her better, but I don't want to be a creeper either. Should I wait for her to text/ friend request me? If not how long should I wait?

TITLE: [20M] Did I miss my chance? What can/should I do?
POST: Hey guys, just looking for a bit of advice for my situation, sorry if it's a bit long. Little bit of background, I'm a 20 year old guy, interested in a 20 year old female friend, we are both juniors and both attend the same university.

Okay, so we've been friends since freshman year, and things have always been going pretty smoothly. We both suffer from social anxiety/depression, and have a lot of interests (politics, shows, movies, music, etc.) in common.

Over the years she always joked that we ""were pretty much a chick flick"" and would end up getting together despite anything that came up. Even when we got drunk and made out this semester (3 separate times), I still kinda laughed the 'chick flick' thing off, but somewhere I knew she was right and we were getting a lot closer together. Anyway, she started getting a bit more hormonal, and when I was away for a weekend she slept with a mutual friend of ours. This is where the problem started.

It became more than a one-time thing, and while they aren't exactly dating, they're at least friends with benefits. She's even said she wasn't really into him at first, but now she likes the FWB. She also said she only got with him to start with because she wanted to lose her virginity, and I didn't put out enough.

It's gotten to the point where I know I'm interested in her, and I'm getting upset seeing her be FWBs with my friend. I want to tell her how I feel because I feel very strongly that we would work well together (not to mention that my friend is very judgmental towards people who drink, people who need anti-depressants, etc., and has made her very upset/cry multiple times with his statements).

Can anyone help me figure out what I should say to her? I'd like to prevent things from getting super awkward if possible, but I don't feel like I can stand around doing nothing anymore...

TITLE: Girlfriend [17F] of 9 months heading off to university, whilst I [18M] am staying home. Advice for long(ish) distance?
POST: First time poster on this sub. Look forward to reading your comments! :)

I've been with my girlfriend since the end of December 2012. We have gone through so much together with being seniors in high school and all the drama about prepping for the future. She's helped me find my way and support my plans for the future and I've done the same for her, she's heading to university now when in December she didn't even think she would be graduating.

She will be moving to a small townhouse with another roommate about 20min from her university in Toronto, Canada. I am staying at home. 

I literally just got home from dropping her off at her current house; she is packing and moving throughout the next few days. We spent the latter part of the evening in tears on her couch, which is big because she doesn't cry all that much.

Her house she will be moving to is probably only a 40+/- minute drive from my place, so not unfeasible by any means, but in comparison to the current 7 minutes is a lot.

She has been in a long distant relationship before with her previous boyfriend, however their relationship wasn't good at all. She wasn't happy with him and he treated her like garbage, so I understand her apprehension.

We both are willing to try it, and I know it's going to be a big change for both of us and not necessarily easy. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)

POST: Relationship is just over a year old, I am 20f, he is 22m.

Earlier this year he asked me to move into his place with his parents over the summer, because in September he is going to school, and I will be going to school for my final year as well. So I took the summer off from my job and am living in his house with his family.

We were talking today about his friend and his girlfriend who have been going out for around 3 years now and my boyfriend mentioned that they probably haven't had sex yet. My boyfriend and I had sex after 2 months of dating... I asked him how far we would have gotten if we had never had sex and he said that I probably wouldn't have moved in this summer if we hadn't. 

So then I asked him what would happen to us if I started to abstain. He just got his cute pouty face on and said that he enjoys our physical side. Then he said that he would probably just ignore me and throw himself into his hobbies so that he doesn't think about sex, or me.

I thought that he had asked me to move in because he loves me... but now it feels like he only asked me to move in because it's easier to have sex whenever he wants it. The sex itself is completely one-sided too... We've been sexually active for 10 months and I haven't been able to orgasm with him once.

So, it's like I said. I used to believe that he wanted me here because he loves me, but now I think he's mostly concerned about sex. I know that he cares about me a lot; he says so and shows me so. But this has really shaken my entire view of our relationship. Any advice on how I can get over this?

I am in a professional healthcare position, but I'm relatively young in my career. Straight out of school (doctoral-level), I got my current job. I've been there now for right at a year, and while I love my job and my coworkers, there are a few downsides. First, I have to commute nearly an hour each way on a busy, dangerous interstate.

That being said, I've been pretty happy and wasn't actively looking for another job; however, I was just offered a job with much better pay, plus it's a telehealth (work-from-home) type job. This is huge considering I just had a baby and hate being so far away from her at my current job. My husband and I feel like this job is a better fit for me right now, but I'm feeling extreme anxiety and guilt over telling my boss. My boss has become a good friend in the time I've been here and has been so good to me. Not to mention I already feel bad because she and her husband have been going through a really hard time trying to have (and keep) a baby, and my husband and I came up pregnant unexpectedly a few months after I started my job and now have a healthy baby girl. I already had to break the news that I was pregnant, now here I am again with upsetting news. I just got back from a 6 week maternity leave about a month ago.

 Also I should mention that our clinic is not very large, so if I leave right now (my job offer wants me to start in two weeks), it leaves her with a ton of extra work until she finds my replacement. Which may take a while - this is not a field that people frequently job-hop. I'm making myself sick over the stress of telling her. But I know deep down that this is the right move for us. Help!

TITLE: Not enough time together? (F21/M21)
POST: Hey Reddit,

So I'll make this quick--My boyfriend and I have been dating for 7 months, but are in a very serious and loving relationship. We attend different universities in the same city. We have both been very busy (engineering/math/jobs/extracurriculars), and it takes roughly 40 minutes to get to each other via public transportation. Anyway, we see each other on the weekends, and he usually comes to my place at least once during the week. However, lately I've just been exhausted--feeling like any free time I have should be devoted to working, studying, etc. I am completely in love with him and LOVE spending time with him, but I'm just starting to notice myself having less and less opportunities to see him.

I actually feel guilty for not having as carefree a schedule as I did prior to meeting him. On top of this, I often find myself apologizing to him and just straight up asking if I'm frustrating him.

So, does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep our relationship stress-free and..well..a thing?

Thanks! :D

POST: I (M24) and my best friend (F22) have run into a bit of a snag. Now to make a long story short we had been together for a year and we decided to go back to being friends. 

I took it a little hard and at first tried to end the friendship because she was making me feel like I wasn't even part of her life. We worked through it and things seemed okay she made a point we both needed some space. 

Recently though I talked to her about how I barely feel like a part of her life and how she makes me feel like a stranger it was like we were barely friends. Suddenly she starts telling me she barely feels like we're friends and she hates it but she still wants space.

POST: I work at a fairly small company, around 20 employees. It's owned solely by our CEO and is a nice place to work.

The finance manager here is kinda ... gossipy. And bitchy, maybe. We're not close, not really friends. We sit on opposite ends of the office. She's ok, but we don't hang out outside of work. I'm not her closest friend at work, she has people she sits with and goes out for lunch with every day. So if she's said something to me, she's probably mentioned it to others.

Last week she ranted to me a bit about her salary. She told me she makes 45k GBP, which she doesn't think is enough. OK. I don't need to know this. Only she THEN tells me how much the CEO makes. She literally tells me the exact details of my bosses take-home pay. She also goes into details of another director's salary.
I am very, very uncomfortable. I've done some googling, and I think this could even be illegal (?). That could be wrong though.

I always thought of my parents as non-judgmental, accepting people.  Upon this realization, I was a little worried, but always kept it in the back of my head that they are sane, smart people, and would accept me no matter what.  

The very night I was going to tell them, my grandmother, informed my parents that she had become an atheist.  The way they talked about her almost made me sick.  My mother talked about how she wasn't going to be saved, and my dad just sat silent with a look of disapproval.  When they talk about her, they often make snide remarks about her decision.  This, of course, made me shut up and not say anything about my own situation.  Their behavior almost makes me ashamed.  What should I do? Should I tell them?

I realized what I had done minutes later and booked it back, but it was gone. It was a Panasonic DVX100B, and I was seriously about to pull the trigger on selling it to upgrade to a Panasonic AG-HMC150. I feel immaculately stupid, and I'm trying my absolute best to put a stop to that and do only the right things from this point forward. I put in a police report minutes after, and today drove around to all the local pawn shops giving them the information so they could keep a lookout. One owner said he'd crack a skull for me if he found the right one. So at least I have that on my side.

The reason I'm making this post is to ask for any other advice on what to do. I want to make sure I do absolutely everything in my power. Not that I think it's likely I'll get it back, I know it's probably pretty futile, but I just want to know I did all that I could.

TITLE: Dear Reddit, how old were you when you realized what you wanted to do with your life?  What were the events that lead to this discovery?
POST: The year was 2008, I had just been kicked out by an ex girlfriends father (complicated story).  I had some 500 dollars to my name and ended up using most of it to pay for a room at this really crappy motel for two weeks.  I had no where else to go and would end up being homeless pretty soon.

During my boredom I decided to head down to the local library and get on line.  Maybe browse a little, hey I might even look at this new fangled thing called 'Reddit'.  Wasn't able to sadly, so instead I browsed the rather crappy collection of books they had there.  There was a 'Electronics For Dummies' book that caught my eye, I grabbed it and started browsing through it.

I was immediately hooked. To my surprise, I was able to check out the book and then proceeded to read it in my shitty, little motel room.  I devoured the entire thing in less then a couple of hours.  The book was originally designed to be read over the course of a couple of days.  The next day I went back to the library and was actually able to get online. 

 I browsed online for more information about electronics, electrical theory, electrical and computer engineering, you name it.  The more and more I read, the more and more I realized that this is what I wanted to do with my life.  I was 19 at the time

TITLE: Christmas gift question with me [21 M] and her [20 F]! Very very tiny question no need to upvote
POST: Ok! Well, I decided to do some special gifts for my girlfriend this year, some blu-rays, a blu-ray player, and an album she has been looking for for years.  

Here's my dilemma, I don't know what order to have her open the gifts XD  
 
If I were to organize them in terms of which is the ""biggest/best"" present, the big gift is this record she has been trying to find forever. I somehow managed to locate it after about 1,000 phone calls to I believe was every record store on the east coast.  

Then probably the blu-ray player, her DVD player is dead, so I figured it was time for an upgrade.  

Then 12 DVDs and Blu-Rays for the blu-ray player.  

Should I start out big with the record? Or should I go with the dvds/blu rays first? Or if I give the blu-rays and dvds first does that does it give away I got her a blu-ray player?  

Or I was thinking, maybe hiding the record, giving the blu-ray player and movies, then after she thinks it's all over... bam, super rare record. 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

POST: I'm a very non-confrontational person and was taught growing up to have great manners and be respectful of others.  When I was 19 I went with my boyfriend at the time to a movie that had been released a few weeks earlier.  I went to the movie weeks after the release date in hopes that there wouldn't be many people in the theater so that I could get the seating I liked best.  Sure enough there were only a few other couples in the theater and I got the perfect seating I wanted.

About 5 minutes after the movie started, two guys came in and sat in the seats right in front of me even though the whole theater was practically empty.  I had my feet resting up on the back of the chair in front of me as one of the guys sat in it.  He politely turned around and asked me if I would put my feet down.  I snapped quicker than I could have ever imagined, raised my voice, and said that I wasn't going to move my goddamn feet and he would just have to deal with it.  While still angered about the situation I started to calm down a few minutes later and was in utter shock that I reacted in that way instead of my usual non-confrontational self.

TITLE: I (20f) am really starting to like a friend (36m).
POST: I've never been in a relationship before because I've never really been interested in casual dating. I'm in my second year of college, and I did research with a Prof with am assigned partner. He's 16 years older than me, which I don't see as a problem. in the beginning, he ignored me unless we were working together with the prof. now we have a class together (we sit together), we are in a club together, we do the same volunteer work outside of school, and we email, but it's always about one of the aforementioned activities. he seems interested, but I have the age old problem of not being able to distinguish between just being friendly or flirting. 

We've never texted or hung out; but we see each other about 7 hours a week. he gets in my personal space and talks to me all the time, but I can't tell if I'm just blinded by wishful thinking. One friend said she thought he liked me, and I hadn't said anything to prompt the opinion. 

basically, I think he might like me but his issues lie with the age difference. Do you have any advice for how to at least further our friendship without scaring him off?

TITLE: Me (20F) with boyfriend (21M) of six months, I was going to break up with him, he just told me he purposefully broke something at work, how can I break up while remaining safe?
POST: First off, names, ages, and irrelevant details have been changed or left out because he is a redditor and I am scared of him finding this.

Important details:

We are medium distance (live about two hours apart). He has some possessions he borrowed from my family and I would like to get them back. He has not shown violent tendencies before this, but I haven't known him that long so I can't say for sure.

I was planning on breaking up with him in person this weekend for various innocuous reasons, the most important being that he frankly bores me to tears and is not worth the gas money. Sorry if that's harsh, it's just the truth. I wasn't gonna tell him this (obviously) but it's the most significant actual reason for breaking up.

However, he just informed me that he purposefully broke an expensive piece of equipment at work because, and I quote, ""he was mad."" I gathered from his tone and the context of the messages that he told me this because he thought it was funny. I am now worried about breaking up with him, I am not sure if it will be safe.  

I need advice on whether or not I am *actually* in any danger (I could potentially be freaking out over nothing), and if I am, I need to know how to break up safely. Preferably I would like to retrieve the items he borrowed from my family.  Thanks in advance!

POST: I really don't want to lose this one, so help much appreciated.

- 3 dates in (over about 3 weeks) after only having met once previously

- Have made out on each one; done dinner; club dancing

- Hilarious snapchat fun when together -- she posts tons of vids of us together to her story for all her friends to see

- Been in healthy contact every day since day 1 via text/snapchat, but rarely talk on phone

- This girl is very cautious, extremely fearful about getting cheated on, also the type I'm thinking sex only once in relationship

- Ik she is dating other guys

- I make her laugh like crazy every day

- I'm struggling connecting with her on a deep emotional level and keeping spark

All sounds good, but on the 3rd date (most recent)...

- This was only about a 2 hour date w/ quick casual dinner

- She was reluctant to a real kiss at the end and kept it to a few quick pecks on the lips -- very different vibe from previous two dates where they were slower and passionate

- There wasn't much romantic spark as it felt more like two friends out than romance; we still touched each other a bit (nonsexual)

She did meet in her work clothes after shift, so maybe just didn't feel sexy?  She stated on a couple occasions that she hope I didn't mind her work outfit...  She was also really camera shy when I tried to capture her.

Anyways, I asked her out to a Friday night show and she enthusiastically responded with a yes!!!  What doesn't sit well with me:

- She said she'd give me money for the ticket (hints friendship?)

- I have a feeling she's trying to duck out of dinner

- When I text her suggesting meeting at my place (like previously), she has dodged the question for over two hours now which REALLY doesn't sit well with me

- Today she referred to us as a ""friendship"" -- trying to test my reaction or trying to send a message?

Today was my birthday. He saw via my Snapchat stories everything I was doing for it -- multiple dinners, bars out, cake, etc. if you're not familiar with snapchat, you can see who is viewing your ""story,"" aka pictures, videos, etc. depicting your day. 

I talked to him YESTERDAY. Did not mention anything about my bday. He has been initiating contact the entire two weeks we've been talking.

He's been watching my stories ALL DAY LONG and hasn't said ONE WORD. 

This feels incredibly/needlessly mean, as if he's purposely ignoring my birthday. It's very frustrating -- everything is going fine and then has to go and ruin it by doing something stupid.

I am supposed to see him in two weeks when he comes to my city for a business trip, but now I just feel icky, stupid, hurt...

She is a super sweet girl and very loving and affectionate towards me...is a great girlfriend for the most part and is very loyal.

Well lately, like the past month, any time she goes out or goes out with her guy friends or what have you she will end up not texting me goodnight or that she made it home safely. I am not the boyfriend who wants to hear from her ALL night long but I am the boyfriend that needs to know shes home safe or at least staying at a friends house. hearing her say goodnight even if VIA text makes me happy and allows me to sleep easy. Multiple times now, about 4 or so, within the past month...mostly all when she goes out...she doesnt call or text me most of the night until later in the afternoon the next day or in the morning as soon as she wakes up. Usually consists of ""Her friend stole her phone"", ""Phone dropped out of her purse at work and didnt realize till she got home""....I can't tell if I am being paranoid or what because I get super annoyed and mad when I have to sit around all night and the next day just to know she's ok? This is the ONLY thing I ever get mad at her for and idk.... shes teh same way if I dont text her while im out or what have you and she gets really annoyed if my phone dies while I'm out but I always text or call her as soon as I get home to let her know im home and safe.

TITLE: Reddit I can't tell if I'm being needy, smothering this girl, or if I have a reason to be mad?
POST: 25[M] dating 25[F]
So I've been dating this girl for 4 months now and we do long distance (3 hours to be exact). 

She is a super sweet girl and very loving and affectionate towards me...is a great girlfriend for the most part and is very loyal.

Well lately, like the past month, any time she goes out or goes out with her guy friends or what have you she will end up not texting me goodnight or that she made it home safely. I am not the boyfriend who wants to hear from her ALL night long but I am the boyfriend that needs to know shes home safe or at least staying at a friends house. hearing her say goodnight even if VIA text makes me happy and allows me to sleep easy. Multiple times now, about 4 or so, within the past month...mostly all when she goes out...she doesnt call or text me most of the night until later in the afternoon the next day or in the morning as soon as she wakes up. Usually consists of ""Her friend stole her phone"", ""Phone dropped out of her purse at work and didnt realize till she got home""....I can't tell if I am being paranoid or what because I get super annoyed and mad when I have to sit around all night and the next day just to know she's ok? This is the ONLY thing I ever get mad at her for and idk.... shes teh same way if I dont text her while im out or what have you and she gets really annoyed if my phone dies while I'm out but I always text or call her as soon as I get home to let her know im home and safe.

Any suggestions on what to do and how to handle this so I dont seem smothering, jealous...etc?

POST: Now, her and I have only been together for about 5 months, but we've gotten extremely close. I do have some insecurity issues that I'm working on and I trust her. Although last night she said something that really bothered me. We got on the topic of sexual kinks and fetishes and it has always been hers to sleep with a married man. Because in her eyes she grew up with sex being very taboo and she loves the forbidden rush sleeping with an older guy (40's) would give her. Is this common amongst women, or is this a red flag I should be weary of? I'll be here to answer any questions but would love some input on the subject. Thanks a lot guys!

TITLE: I [17M] don't feel wanted by my girlfriend [17F]
POST: Okay, so about 2 months ago I met this really nice girl and after about a month of hanging out together we kissed and have been together since. 
She is my first ""actual"" girlfriend, and I'm very happy to be with her and enjoy spending my time with her.

Before I continue I should say that both of us are virgins (but she doesn't know I am) and I'm her first boyfriend as well

About a week after we first kissed we were at my house and we started kissing (this was our first time really going at it) I touched her tits (her skin is SUPER sensitive) and was making my way down there when she politely asked me to stop, I obliged
She explained to me that she felt embarrassed, she later told me that she wouldn't go beyond third base as she doesn't feel ready yet, alright.
She also told me that she didn't enjoy kissing (me), this hurt me a bit, and made me feel unwanted. 
After that event whenever I see her I just kiss her when saying hi and bye. 
She sometimes gets closer to kiss me but now I never go in for it first, it feels good when she gets closer, but she is more of a submissive person and she's constantly apologizing for not showing much affection. 
I guess my fear of being rejected + the fact that she told me she doesn't like kissing (and that she only told me afterwards) make me afraid of getting more intimate with her 

So now I don't know how to feel about us, a small part of me thinks she just wants a boyfriend so she can say she has one. I still think she's super nice and I really like her but, eeh I don't know. I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I think sex is important in a relationship.... maybe it's just because I'm a horny teen, maybe I just rushed in like a crazy mofo, I'm new to this, but I don't want to go on like this and don't know what to do without hurting her feelings

TITLE: My [M17] GF [F17] never asks me to hang out
POST: I posted this in /r/relationship_advice but didn't get much feedback so I'm guessing this is a more appropriate sub for this kind of thing.

Alright this may just be a minor issue, but I'm not sure and it's pretty frustrating. I've been dating her for just over 4 months and overall things are going really well. However over the past couple of weeks I've realized that I'm always the one asking her to hang out and go on dates places. We hang out 1-2 times per week and out of the ~30 we've been together she's asked to hang out twice.

She always says yes - in fact, she hasn't even once asked to do something other than what I've suggested. She's been away a lot the past couple of weeks, and says things like ""I miss you so much it hurts"" ""I wish you were here"" ""I have so many stories to tell you"" etc., so it's pretty confusing as to why she just doesn't ask to hang out.

Like last night at 10:15 we were texting and she jokingly asked if I wanted to come over; we joked about me sneaking out and stuff like that and then I said ""yeah I dont think tonight will work..I do want to come over though"" And still nothing. Changed topic and then she went to bed around 11.. She probably expected me to ask her but it's frustrating because I feel like if she was actually interested she'd start asking once in a while.

Oh, another thing that's semi-related: Whenever she comes to my house, she's consistently an hour+ late. No excuses or anything - for example if I ask her to come over at 5 she'll text me at 5:30 saying she's starting to walk over....However that's the only time she's late; whenever we go out somewhere she's on time, and when I go over to her house she's always there/ready to hang out.

I just want to know if this is anything to worry about and what I should do about it. Thanks.

The second thing she pointed out is that I never do anything just to make her happy  (like bringing flowers), so the only thing she can be happy about is the fact that I do some mediocre cleaning. 

I grew up with parents that never showed any kind of affection for each other. Unsurprisingly to me and my sister, my parents left each other when we moved out. Because of this I have no idea on how to give her what she's asking for.

Yesterday, I went to her apartment to check up on her, and seen that she was clearly crying before I got there. I had to ask, I just had to confront her about it.

Here's what happened when I tried:

Me: ""Listen, I know that you've kind of had a rough time lately. And I want to help you out, but I can't do anything if you won't talk to me about it.""

Her: ""Sweetheart I told you, I'm fine.""

Me: ""No you aren't. It's obvious something's been eating at you. You can tell me.""

Her: ""Why is me saying 'I'm fine' not good enough? You're concerned, I get that. That's cool. But I'm fine, and it's nothing that you need to worry about.""

That reply caught me off guard and I didn't know what to say. I feel like it's the boyfriend's responsibility to know the well-being of his girlfriend. What you guys think I should've said after that without coming off as a controlling boyfriend who wants her to spill out every secret? She's the first person I've truly cared about on a deeper level. It's been hard to do so.

TITLE: Computer Science Degree?
POST: So, I like computers(programming, data manipulation, multimedia, repair, etc.) , I like numbers, and I like to argue. Third year college student deciding to switch from PreMed Biology.

Option A: Accounting degree on to Law School for Corporate Law.
          Pros: Job security, pay, and ""prestige"" (whatever the f*** that is), OR just do litigation and open private office.
          Cons: Stay in school until I am 27-28, very stressful, LONG hours. Basically why I am staying away from Pre-Med with less bodily fluids involved.

Option B: Computer Science BS and then Masters.
         Pros: Majority of career paths more relaxing than Option A, I really enjoy computers, and pay possibly?
         Cons: All the bullsh!t I am hearing about how useless and obsolete you become.

Basically I am wondering if a Computer Science Degree is ""worth it?"" I mean I keep hearing about all this outsourcing yadda yadda and age discrimination... basically not being able to keep a steady job nor one past the age of 45. I would love just to write code, do information security or just solve problems all day, maybe even 3D rendering or animation (I am one of those ""if its creative (music, art, etc.) I can do it"" kind of people). I don't mind keeping up with certificated or learning something new every day.. I mean that is just technology in general. But I would like to have a decent enough salary to start a family one day and not be up to my eyeballs in debt.

TITLE: My [31 F] Mother [64 F] talks incessantly during movies and TV shows. I get irrationally angry by this and then yell at her which makes both of us sad. What can I do?
POST: She just won't shut up. 

It can be a movie or show we have never seen before, or one that I've seen before, or one that she has seen before.  

Example of movie neither of us has seen before: 

Her: ""Who's that guy? Why did that guy say that? What does that mean???!""

Me: ""I don't know.  I've never seen this before, either. I think they are trying to create some suspense because we don't know, let's just let the story unfold."" 

Her: ""What did that guy say when I said 'who's that guy?'  Why did that lady say that to him? Who's that?""

Me: ""SHHHHHH!!!!! You're ruining the movie for everyone!!! Just shut up, already!""

Of course, it's even worse if she has seen the movie before and you haven't.  Then it's a continual dialogue of ""You won't believe what's going to happen next! Can you guess?  I can tell you!  Here's what's about to happen."" 

Is there anyway to stop this?  For the most part, I have just very rarely watched anything with her for the last 15 years and when I have I have made sure it was nothing that I did not mind being ruined.

POST: I stayed in a motel in California last week and while we were there I noticed a few bites on my kids, but didn't think anything of it and assumed it was just a reaction to the humidity. I've gotten back home and my kids (2 & 4) have numerous bites all over them and are miserable. I don't yet know if I have infested my home but I've checked into a hotel ($101/night) for the next three days to spray and clean everything we brought back with us from the vacation. My wife is visibly freaked out and doesn't even sleep well anymore since she hates bugs and is constantly checking herself over in the mirror to make sure she isn't covered in bugs.

TITLE: TIFU By Playing Hide and Seek.
POST: My FU starts about a week ago. I was babysitting my sister-in-laws kids with my wife. They are a boy and girl, ages 2 and 5 respectively. Shortly before bed time they asked if I could play hide and seek with them. This is kind of a tradition with us and we do it every time we watch them, they enjoy it because I make it really easy for them. Having my feet stick out from under a blanket for example. 

Anyway I chose to hide in the bathroom right behind the door. It was my nephews turn to find everyone. He had found everyone else already and I could hear him getting closer to my hiding spot. And this is where my FU happens. I get the brilliant idea to say boo right when he comes around the door. He sticks his head around the door and we make eye contact. I yell the loudest boo I ever had he screams and then starts giggling that giggle little kids do when they've just seen the funniest thing ever.  Alls good right? Nope.

Fast forward about a week and I get a call from my sister in law asking me why her two year old, who she has been struggling with potty training for a while now, is suddenly afraid of bathrooms. I tell her what happened and that I thought everything was okay. She starts yelling at me about being irresponsible etc. etc. Then she calls my wife and chews her out.

POST: So some background info. This is my first relationship and we were going out for 4 years before breaking up. We met in college in a small program and over the years have made several mutual friends, that are in the same program as the both of us.

Now from reading up on r/relationships I know the first thing to do is cut all contact. But how do I go about doing this when it's likely that I will be seeing her at parties and other events. Should I just not go to events where I think she'll be? Most if not all our friends are good mutual friends so this is a tough situation for me.

Other than this what should I be doing? Currently I'm just sitting around at home, watching Netflix or hanging out with friends once in a while. I'm not sure how to get over this break up, as i feel like i won't find someone like her again. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks everyone.

We've been arguing A LOT the last couple of years and it was always because I started it.

I love her and to be honest she'll be happier without me in her life right now. But I need her. I know I can change back to be the person I was before all the insecurity, the person she fell in love with before. After the break up, we agreed to stay as friends and we can revisit our life in a few months to see if we really need each, and if we do we can get back together. I don't want to wait a few months.

TITLE: I [23F] somehow, even after years pass, end up reconnecting with my ex [24M]. We're just really bad at being friends.
POST: We dated on and off in high school and college, even did a year of long distance we he joined the Navy. Its been two years since we broke up and in attempts to test the ""friendship waters"" I inadvertently stirred up a lot of emotions within him.

 I feel naive, for even trying, but it seemed ok at first. Short and amicable. About a month or so later though, it kind of blew up. Its not just emotions about our past, but a lot of anxiety about his job. He doesn't have any support systems and is under a tremendous amount of pressure.

POST: My boyfriend is in the army and stationed about 4 1/2 hours away from my location. I have a great friend who is gay. She wants to start working out, and my bf is a huge fitness buff, so I asked if he could help her out. They exchanged numbers, are on each others instagram, and snapchat as well. 

Today, my friend kept talking about him and how great he is. She then was going to show me something on her phone, and her snapchat was on and I saw his  name a few times. 

No biggie I guess, I don't want to make a big deal over something like snapchat. I don't want to be childish. He told me last night he couldn't really talk on the phone since his battery was dying.

TITLE: Took Adderall for the first time today as someone with ""controllable"" ADD, and it had amazing effects.  ADD/ADHD'ers of reddit, what are normal vs. medicated days like for you?
POST: I'll start off by saying that ""controllable"" ADD is probably not a real thing. If I went to a doctor I may not be diagnosed, but honestly I've never considered doing it because even though I have many of the symptoms (distracted easily, jump from task to task frequently, trouble focusing all the time), it's definitely a mild case, and I've gotten by in school and work so far. It's more of a frustration than anything else, but since it's mild and if I try hard I can focus, it's not worth adding to the statistics of an already over-diagnosed disorder.

But I tried one of my friend's Adderall's this morning at work, and after the initial paranoia of what's going to happen after trying a new drug, I had 6 of the most efficient hours of work I can remember.  It was unbelievable the focus and drive I had to complete task after task, all while happily ignoring my personal email account, text messages, and my usual distractions.

What got me thinking was that I only took a third to half of my friend's pill, so I'm wondering what is it like for those of who have a strong case of ADD/ADHD? Does medication bring you to full focus like I experienced, or is it more controllable distractions? What are the days off the medication like? Do you ever avoid taking your meds because it feels like you're not being *you*?

POST: It might be worth reading my post from last week. I can't link it because I'm on mobile. 

I've been incredibly busy just recently. I've just finished an intense 1 year nursing course and it's been back to back for months. My last few assignments were in this week so I took last week of work and just worked from 9am to 1am pretty much every day.

It was my mothers birthday on Sunday and I phoned her on the Friday before. I told her I was hoping to visit on the Sunday, but I was massively drowning in work that had to be in Monday at 8am, so I wasn't sure when or for how long or if at all. She said this wasn't a problem at all, and to leave it until the week if I was so busy. Great. 

Since the weather was nice she decided (on the Saturday) to have a bbq on her birthday (Sunday) and invited my sister and BIL and kids over, plus her sister and husband and kids. I was still drowning in work on the Sunday, and since she had so many other people over and therefore just visiting for 15 minutes seemed impossible, I rang her and told her I wouldn't be able to make it. Again, she was fine and said to visit in the week. 

Yesterday I spoke to my sister who told me how upset and disappointed my mother is for me not visiting. My sister  couldn't understand why 15 minutes would ruin my plan for the day (15 minutes would be more like an hour and there's travel and everything else). I made the point that if she really wanted me there she could have said at any point. She told me not to come if I was busy and so I didn't. How am I supposed to know it would make her upset when she told me to do it?!

I don't know whether to bring this up with my mother or just let it blow over?
It's made me feel awful that I've upset her but I believed I was doing as she wanted.

POST: My partner dumped me close to 2 months ago because she 'wasn't sure about us' anymore. We resolved to remain friends but have subsequently gone no contact. It wasn't entirely unexpected, she had been distant for a month prior and I think she was just waiting for our exams to be over. 

I never expected to get over her quickly but so far everything has been a lot harder than I expected. I feel worse now than I did initially. It's Christmas today and I can't feel happy. I started crying at lunch with my family. I constantly find myself thinking about her and what we had. Anytime I do anything that is remotely enjoyable my mind just reverts back to thinking about her. 

We were each others best friends for so long I'm feeling abandoned now that she's gone. The fact that neither of us screwed the relationship up and that she made a conscious choice to leave me hurts the most I think. If you looked at her FB profile now it would seem like I never existed and that we didn't share our lives for the last 7 years. 

I found myself stalking her on social media and have no unfollowed her on FB, deleted her texts and her number. I really want to start feeling like I'm moving on from this relationship but I can't. I know I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't love me but my rational thoughts are having no effect on my emotions.

POST: My partner dumped me close to 2 months ago because she 'wasn't sure about us' anymore. We resolved to remain friends but have subsequently gone no contact. It wasn't entirely unexpected, she had been distant for a month prior and I think she was just waiting for our exams to be over. 

I never expected to get over her quickly but so far everything has been a lot harder than I expected. I feel worse now than I did initially. It's Christmas today and I can't feel happy.

TITLE: I met an attractive girl at a party, hooked up with her, and got her number, but I was blackout drunk, and barely remember anything past 9pm. What do I say now?
POST: Sad facts:

-As far as I can remember, she was sober.
-I was drunk.
-It took me at least fifteen minutes to remember her name the next morning.
-She goes to a big University in my city, while I go to a small college and was just there to party.
-I was REALLY drunk.

Pretty much, I can't comprehend how I got a (what I remember as) hot girl's number in that state, let alone a SOBER hot girl's number. For some background, I 'get' an acceptable amount of ladies (I have a healthy sex life for a first year Uni. student), I'm not desparate, but I seem to think she was smart/fun, which for me is -in combination with good looks- the most attractive trait of a woman. She texted me hello right after I gave her my number, and I decided it was best not to reply in that state. I have definitely taken a number and never texted it before, but I feel I have to. Now, I am putting my faith in Reddit, all of which I know are professionals in this field. (Source: I have been lurking. Thanks to Reddit, I know now that everyone on the internet is a professional, and that they are always telling the truth.)

TITLE: I[22 M] need some help and advice regarding my 4 year long relationship with my ex [22F] .
POST: A little background story . I was in a relationship with my ex for about 4 and a half years and its been about a year since we broke up . We used to go to the same college and are in the same class . We've had a break from college for about a year and we did finally call it quits when we had to take the break . (this was August 2014)

While we were dating I never did prove to be what you'd call a good boyfriend. So our relationship was pretty on-off . So in the month of December 2014 she started talking to her ex again and I didn't like that much . I told her she should try and not meet him in private but I wasn't very firm about it since i did trust her alot and i knew she'd never do something that would disappoint me . Well , that cost me . She did cheat on me with her ex twice while we were dating and now she's currently dating that guy . 

The main problem here is that i don't really feel like its all her fault . Part of the reason she did cheat was probably because i didn't live up to her expectation of a good boyfriend. 

After this saga with her , I've had some serious trust issue with other people . I can safely say I didn't trust anyone more than her and now i cant trust anyone at all . Its eating me inside for really long and I really don't have to many close friends who i can share any of this with .. 

I really would love for anyone who has felt the same to give me some advice . College starts again in July and i dont know what having to see her face daily will do to me.. Need some help ..Thanks in advance .

I broke up with her once, but then she started crying, being a sensitive guy, it tore me up to see it and we got back together. Ever since then I wish I would've stuck with my decision. It's been about 7 months since then, and its been bugging me.

I don't know how to pull the trigger.. I still do love her very much, we were each others first for sex. And this is the first long relationship for the both of us. but we have some key differences between us. And I know that I don't want to put a ring on her in the future.

I'm a student in the UK completing my last year in sixth form. I'm doing an EPQ in sociology (an epq is kind of like a mini dissertation; mine is a 6000 word report, although it can be other things too).

As the title says I have been doing the bare minimum (aka practically nothing) for the past 7 months. I can't/don't want to handle stress so I just didn't do my work. *""Oh I'll do it later, it'll be fine I'll switch them out, he wont even notice"".*

Noope.

I never got round to doing, well anything. Obviously I had to show my supervisor ~something~ so I falsified all my research. I made up interviews and made fake graph results all whilst promising myself I'll get round to it. Well I didn't and everything is due in in less than 12 hours and I'm fucking screwed. I've only written 1000 words.

The first month of living together was smooth but the last two months (moved in together in June) have been really, really hard. I'm concerned my stress is killing us. I have a new job that started in July that is stressful and am dealing with some family stress, my brother has a heroine addiction has been in and out of the hospital for relapses. I've had to be involved in some hospital visits but have made the decision to be less involved and ""detach"" for my own sanity. My family, as a result, isn't a stable support system. I have a lot of great friends that are supportive and try to keep positive people in my life best I can. I've taken a lot of stress home with me and felt insecure due to the lack of stability and unfortunately have taken some of this out on my boyfriend. I am never mean to him but have started a lot of arguments that I probably would have let go if I wasn't stressed. He tends to need his space when he is stressed while I crave extra support. Mostly we've had tiffs about stupid issues but have noticed he wants more space than usual. I just started therapy to address my family issues and am working hard to give him his space and respect it. 

Some of the arguments I think have been normal moving in together arguments, but they seem to happen frequently (never yelling or anything awful) because of all the stress I am carrying. I am optimistic about the relationship but fear I have damaged it. I haven't violated his trust but have been clingy (which really isn't me in a normal state) and overwhelmed. I take effort to do things I enjoy that are fun and away from home. How much of an adjustment should moving in together be?

TITLE: Fiance [30M] refuses to LET me [28F] sign a prenuptial agreement (4 years)
POST: Don't really know what I'm looking to get out of this. I guess I just need a place to organize my thoughts. My fiance has been a hard worker his entire life and his hard work paid off in a big way financially last year. We both agreed that we did not want to change our lifestyle so all of the extra money is going into investments for our future. It's really easy to forget about it. That being said, forgetting about something doesn't make it disappear. I know my fiance's parents have never liked me very much and they were the first people to propose the idea of a prenup. I was a little upset about what I perceived their implications were but I had no problems with signing it. I *want* to sign it, not because they are asking, but because it's the reasonable thing to do. My fiance, on the other hand, is appalled by the idea. He dismissed the need because he thinks that signing it is equivalent to acknowledging that our relationship will fail and he tells me that is not a possibility. He's my sweetheart. I believe that he truly believes that kind sentiment but I know that it's not realistic. Shit happens.  Sometimes things don't go as planned and that's what prenups are for.

I don't know. I've pleaded with him non-stop to sign it with me but he refuses. I'm considering calling off the wedding unless he signs it because I don't think it's fair for either of us to go into this marriage without one.

FTR: I have very little assets. I work for an organization that deals with orphaned and vulnerable children. While I love working there with all my heart, it does not pay very well.

Opinions on the situation? Thoughts regarding whether or not calling off a wedding because of a prenup is reasonable given these circumstances?

TITLE: [auto accident] Never been in an accident, but got in a minor car accident & screwed up getting information
POST: CA, State farm.

I was backing out of my driveway at 5mph and hit a moving car (maybe 30mph) going along the street. My car has a big scrape along the back bumper with a circular part (guessing the spot for towing?) missing and hers is the typical scrape-in/deformation for the side doors. 

She was in a rush (just had a stroke and couldn't think well) and I was in an emotional rush from the accident and late to work. She asked for name, cell #, and insurance info. I gave her that and wrote them on a paper for her since she couldn't write well or something from getting out of the hospital from just having a stroke. 

I asked for name and cell # and she said she couldn't find her insurance currently so she would give it when she would get her insurance to call my insurance.

Upon leaving, I realized I fked up majorly both on not looking more carefully and on not getting more information. What else should I have done?

Here's my current reflections:

Neither party got Drivers license information (I could have faked the info I put down if i wanted but I would never do that.)
Neither party took pictures (wow I'm feeling stupid)
Neither party filed a police report due to forgetfullness or rush (unaware of repercussions of this -- I'm assuming it's illegal and we may get in trouble?)

I failed to get her insurance info (not sure what I should have done if she claimed she couldn't find it currently )

Please feel free to add and correct any of my mistakes above ^

Lastly, what do I do now? Do i play the waiting game? What should I be expecting the next moves to be? I'm going to set off a few thousand in cash to be ready to pay for some damages that insurance always seems to not be able to cover. All I know is a deductible is something I have to pay and hopefully the insurance pays the rest, and then my insurance prices shoot up for me getting in an accident :(.

This is my first accident so I want to learn from this and follow procedure properly in the future.

TITLE: My [27m] GF [26] expresses worry over her being my first and only - how to tackle?
POST: I [27m] have been seeing my first and only girlfriend [26] for a good year now. We've been getting along just fine, with our own share of minor arguments along the way that have been taken care of and not buried in some deep dark corner. 

Now, the topic of marriage has popped up, and there's one thing that she has expressed concern over, and it's the fact that I have never dated seriously before I met her. On her end, she has had 4 other relationships, with me being her fifth boyfriend. She has gone as far as saying that if I decided to break up with her because I wanted to see other girls, she wouldn't hold that against me. 

In response, I've told her, and even felt that because we click so well and have so many things we share in common, I could not possibly think of breaking up with her, and that it would take a lot for me to let her go. To be honest, if I had the financial means right now, I would go out, buy a ring and immediately propose to her. That's how much I love her. I can picture being with her for the rest of my life - a sentiment she has echoed. 

That leads to this question: am I really missing out because I haven't had other relationships? I've heard that the point of dating is to get to know what one's preferences, expectations and dislikes are, and to tweak it until one finds his or her match. On top of that, I also heard it's almost never a good idea to marry your first love. So, what gives?

At one point I already knew she liked a certain person and had a gut feeling that it was going to be a long distance relationship. Some time ago, she contacted me and said she wanted to talk.

POST: This actually happened a couple of weeks ago, but I'm sure you don't give a shit. 

My brother and his wife wanted to be alone for a couple of days so I told him I'd watch my nephew for him. I will probably never have kids so I treat him like my own, he's my best bro. He is 5 and I let him pick what we watch, so he knows how to work my apple TV pretty well. 

Well recently, I started to watch Attack on Titan (not an anime fan, just like that particular show) while my he was sleeping. I had a rough day at work so I decided to hit the rack. I thought I exited all the way out but apparently it was still in my TV shows. 

Nephew got up, saw my TV shows open, clicked the first episode and began watching. I woke up to him in chair already into some big scene where titans are eating people, crying. Not tearing up, but full on waterworks. He kept screaming and screaming that a titan was going to get him. I finally got him calmed down and put into bed again. I text my brother what happened and he thought it was funny.

Fast forward to yesterday, Nephew has been having nightmares but it has been managable. My brother text me this today (cant get the damn thing to add the picture, ill just copy and paste it)

""Listen up, Douchecanoe, I took Caleb to the mall today and at that fucking anime stand there is a large cutout of a titan. Caleb saw it started screaming and running away and I eventually had to pick him up and rush out the store looking like I was kidnapping him. Luckily for me, the cops eating their fucking Sbarro thought I was kidnapping him and detained me until Sherlock Holmes Dr Watson and the fucking CSI team determined I was his Dad. I am going to kick your fucking ass. All of this in front of hundreds if not thousands of people""

POST: Okay, so this actually happened last night, not today. Anyway, my brother is on our High School Varsity Football team and I had to go to one of his away games since our Grandparents were going. Well I'm watching the game and our band shows up, and since I know a few of them, I decided to ditch my family and talk to my band friends. Well fast forward three quarters and I'm pretty thirsty, so me and my friend (let's call him S) and his friend (let's call him L) walk down to the concession stand. It's a long line, so me and L start talking and he says he wants to show me something, and he then proceeds to pull out his wallet and show me a joke fake ID, [which looked something like this] except L's had a little girl and said his full name. Now, being the awkwardly funny guy that I am, a joked popped into my head, a brilliant, hilarious joke, and I plopped it on him. ""You look like a holocaust survivor!""

TITLE: I [17F] am having family troubles accepting my boyfriend [18M]
POST: I have had a rough start (very on and off) with my boyfriend since I was 11. We have basically been together for 6 years (some trip ups here and there) and despite many problems we had, we are very strong together. 

When I was about 14, our parents confronted which resulted in his parents telling my family off that I was disrupting his education and we could no longer be together. It was very messed up, his father would tell my parents to discipline him because he wouldn't listen to his own parents.

We had many discussions about whether we wanted to be together but we stuck with it anyway. His father had said some things to my mother that made her retract instantly and cut off all communication.

Fast forward about 3 years and my boyfriend has finished high school. His parents have noticed that we are serious about each other as we managed to stick with each other so they have accepted the fact that I'm going to be sticking around. However, upon mentioning him to my mother, she said that ""it's great that he is a great friend to you, but he will never be your boyfriend"" which obviously was a shock to me because of how long I have been together with him (she wasn't aware). I have been building up his image to my mother and he is genuinely a great boyfriend.

My mother is worried that I'm going to get hurt, but I really do love my boyfriend and we want to be together. The problem is that his parents and family finally accept me, but my mother cannot because of what happened. I'm afraid of telling her and feel certain that she's set on not allowing me to be with him because of HIS father, not him. 

Any personal experiences, advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

POST: Throwaway because I am going to break up with my girlfriend tonight and she has a reddit.  We have been together for 3 years total.  We broke up for a 4 month stretch because I was unsure of the future of our relationship, but have been back together for about 6 months.  I love her a lot, so I want to hurt her as little as possible, so I am unsure if I should give her the reason I am breaking up with her. 

Why I am breaking up is as follows. She decided that she wanted to wait until she got married to have sex again, but he have been previously intimate.  I don't really have an issue with that because I believe that sex is important and should only be shared by two people who love each other.  I have had two partner before her and both were long term relationships.  She however has a much more extensive past.  She wouldn't disclose her number of past partners, besides saying she regrets it and it doesn't matter.  I really don't know any specifics but I do know her friends that she hung out with and so I can put together an educated guess. 

It always kind of bothered me, but she had changed her ways so I got over it.  That was until she decided that we weren't going to have sex again unless I married her.  I feel like if she was like that with other guys then why should I wait for her.  So I am going to break up with her and she is going to want to know why.

* The GUL plan currently costs $0.23/month for each $10k of coverage. I can increase or decrease the coverage amount at any time.

* The cost of the insurance goes up as I age, but the big increases won't hit until my 40s or 50s. I plan to decrease the coverage amount over time as I save more money (eventually dropping it entirely).

* The GUL plan also has an optional ""Cash Accumulation Account"" which I would not contribute to.

* As a point of comparison, a 10-year guaranteed term policy would cost me $0.27/month to $0.41/month for each $10k of coverage (quotes from term4sale.com)

POST: So I work in retail, and I was finishing up my stray cart (basically putting away all of the items that shoppers abandon either at the registers or all over the store.) It was nearing closing time, and I wanted to get this shit done. I was on my way up to the front of the store with my now empty cart. These carts aren't like your usual shopping carts, they are very short and stocky and have this weird metal bar/basket a few inches off of the ground that supports the main cloth basket. So anyway, I'm walking quite briskly with the cart, and I guess I took too long of a stride. I end up stepping right onto this bar, causing the cart to fly right out of my hands with my foot still on it, nearly making me do the splits. I try to grab onto a mannequin stand to break my fall, but I just ended up smashing my elbow into the stand and falling right on my ass anyway.

We've been keeping it friendly, she called me when she was sick & I brought her dinner & slept over. We cuddled all night but nothing serous. I admitted last week that I missed her & she called me and wanted to see me because she ""wanted a hug"" & we got coffee & kissed. 

Today she called me for help with her internet & I went to our old apartment to set it up for her but when I tried for a kiss she said it would make things complicated. I want her back but I don't want to play this game if it doesn't end well.

POST: My girlfriend [F/age 21] and I [M/age 18] broke up after about 4 months back in august in 2013 before school started.

Before we broke up we both went on vacation with our own families. This could be a cause, because we didn't see each other for about 2 months in which when she returned we broke up over text messages (note: I never saw her after the day i left for vacation) which was around first week of july in 2013. But the reason i think she broke up with me is because of school, she wanted to focus in university.

Btw I go to college and I am in a program with mostly guys and the only interactions with a girl i get is my best friend.

Ever since we broke we don't talk much as we use to, or talk at all. I have cried over her several times and still miss her a lot and think about her. I thought she was the one.

So i need help in what to do... should i tell her my feelings or try to stay strong and hope it gets better? Basically i agreed we could just be friends even though i didn't want to be and it seemed like it was a bit hard for her too... but it seems like we are not even that much of friends anymore.

TITLE: Me [19 F] should I be trying to help my brother[16 M] with his life?
POST: This is my first Reddit post and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right, but thank you if you read it and I'm sorry for my relatively scatterbrained writing!

My brother (we'll call him George) does very poorly at school, has bad hygiene and spends every minute of his time on the computer.  He's a smart kid, but he's fallen so far behind in school that he's not even in standard classes anymore.  He also struggles in those classes and has never brought home homework since about third grade.  I think he is passing one course right now, and that would be metal work.

My parents seem to have given up and it's bothering me.  I regret not trying harder in school (I was about average) and I know it's not fair to push what I regret onto him, but it hurts me to see him do absolutely nothing.  He wants to be a mechanic but as of now he will not graduate with everyone his age, if at all.  The only time he is not playing video games is when the internet is off from midnight to six in the morning and when he's at school.  Which leaves about eight or so hours on weekdays and he plays twelve on weekends not counting the time he spends watching movies.

Maybe I'm being prissy and should butt out, but I feel like he should not be able to waste all that time away and fail school.  There is absolutely no consequences for his lack of attention at school or even the fact that he brushes his teeth only a couple times a week.  I've tried gentle helping, I've tried talking to my parents who tell me I'm not the adult (they're right and I live under their roof so I have to obey them), I've tried cutting back his computer usage to three hours on weekdays and five hours on weekends but he gets through it.  I've tried countless things.

Reddit, should I just leave him be and worry about myself?  I love him to death and I miss talking to him like we used to.  It's been like this for awhile.   Maybe it's puberty, I don't know.  I'm at a loss.  Someone tell me what to do.

We had a messy falling out when I wouldn't commit to her. I haven't spoken to her since. After a year she sent me a message on facebook asking what I'm up too and that type of stuff. I thought she was mad at me this entire time. We ended up meeting up and started talking. And she was really probing me about who I'm with. I told her I'm not looking for a girlfriend. She was insistent that I need a girlfriend which I thought was weird. Were both pretty experienced and open so we talked a lot about sex. She didn't mind me putting my hands on her but she was hesitant to go any further. 

She mentioned she was thinking about moving to another state when we were messaging on facebook. But what she didn't tell me until later on that it was to live with her fiance who's in the military. Her fiance doesn't live here. While we were talking her fiance called and she didn't mention to him that I was there hanging out with her. I got the feeling that it wasn't the fiance that was stopping her from going further. It felt more like she didn't know if she could trust me because I know I'm not the purest dude out there.

This was do to me having issues coming from an abusive and broken home , and I did what most children do 'and act out and chose to smoke pot because i was sad i didnt have the white picket fence i saw everyone else have, and for that i was thrown to the wolves the run the streets. After being told a few days ago that i am a problem still and i am a negative influence and that is why i am not invited to any holiday celebration, or told of family events because i choose to still smoke ( with a DR backing me i might add) I get awoken to another family member being like lol i got the young ones high last night isnt that cool? ya super cool ....... i hang with you , you hang with them, you get them high so thats gonna be my fault in my dads crazy ass wife""s loopy brain,yup awesome!

TITLE: Dear Reddit, Any computer geeks out there can help me with this simple task?
POST: So I recently got a kindle, and it is awesome! I really can't keep my hands off of it. I loaded it with a few books, and everything is working perfectly.
Now, I am trying to convert some PDF's to .mobi's using Calibre (great program). I've had issues after converting the PDF's with page numbers. The page numbers are all over the place on the kindle, as well as the title (which normally would appear at the top of the page on the PDF, but appears in random places). I looked around online, to try to figure out how to remove the header and footer (title and page number), and stumbled upon a forum that included codes to remove them. I am not good with codes, and it seemed foreign and difficult to me. After much frustration, I finally discovered a trick that I thought would work. I saw that you could use Mac OSX's preview application to crop the title and page number. What I did was select the entire page (from right under the title at the top, to right above the page number at the bottom. I saved the PDF, and that that was the solution to my problem. What I got was a nice, clean looking PDF without the title at the top of each page, and sans page numbers. I thought it was finally going to be able to convert to .mobi flawlessly, but when I saw the converted .mobi, the page numbers and title on each page were still there? Magic? How did that happen? Can anyone help me get rid of these pesky titles and page numbers on every damn page? I would be ever grateful. This is the only thing holding back my unconditional love towards my kindle.
TL;DR: "," How can I remove the header and footer (title and page number) from a PDF?

TITLE: Worried about getting into grad school for Comp Sci
POST: So I'm a junior math major/comp sci minor at a pretty decent US university and frankly, I'm scared shitless about getting into a decent grad school after undergrad.  

I've always wanted to go to grad school after undergrad, but I'm really worried about my GPA.  It's not mortifyingly terrible (2.89) but clearly its not stellar either.  It's not that I have trouble with the material, its just that my procrastination has dealt me a couple of severe blows and sometimes freeze up on tests.

I've been working with a post-doc on his research for about a year and by the time I graduate I should be co-author on two publications which I hear really helps, but I don't know how much this will compensate for my GPA.

TITLE: I'm 19 years old and I have arthritis. I need advice...
POST: I tore my ACL and meniscus 2 years ago playing tennis. I had surgery a few weeks later and it was painful. I hated the whole experience. But I knew I needed it. I listened to my doctor and my physical therapist and I thought I was doing fine. But I was still in pain and I had no range of motion in my knee. The doctor said I needed another surgery because scar tissue had built up in my knee. I was devastated. I decided to get a second opinion from another doctor and he agreed with my original doctor. So I had another surgery 3 months after my first surgery. 

This was all 2 years ago in 2009. Since then I have regained all range of motion but I'm still in a lot of pain. It hurts to walk most days and sometimes I can't walk at all. I was told about a different doctor further from where I live who specialized in Orthopedic pain so I decided to ask him what was going on and if he could fix it. That's when he told me that I have early stages of arthritis. He says I will definitely need total knee replacement in 20 years and that there is nothing I can do for the pain.

So I guess I'm just asking how I can live with this. I feel so pathetic right now knowing that I'm not going to be able to do simple things like go up stairs without being in pain. I just need helpful words and maybe options for what I can do... Thanks for reading if you did

I'm giving it to him tonight. I was going to wait until his birthday (December) but figured it will be really useful for the current semester. It's his early birthday/Christmas gift and he has no idea it's coming.

TITLE: My [M/21] girlfriend [F/21] of 5 years has suddenly changed?
POST: Okay I dont know where to begin but I need to say this and get some advice. When I was younger, I met this beautiful woman that eventually became my girlfriend. Over the years, we have had our ups and downs like any relationship.

This is the girl who would always love seeing me and we would have a blast for hours. This year though, I have noticed that she  has not been acting the same way as she used too. Whenever I would see her, she would try to quickly get me to leave. She became more secretive about who she was texting. She would often cancel plans when I wanted to see her. Our conversations over the phone our through text would become her just saying some short replies like ""Ok"" and ""Yeah"" etc.

I finally said that enough was enough and decided to confront her about this. When I asked her about why she has been acting so different recently, she told me that she doesn't know what she wants from our relationship anymore. I was confused because we have always been so close throughout the years. I asked her when she started to feel like this and she got annoyed and kept saying that she doesn't know.

We decided that we were going to ride this out and see how it goes but her way of doing this is to just push me aside until she says she might ""feel different"". I don't want this relationship to end and I want to try anything to help make it better.

TITLE: Age Registrictions VS Educational Restrictions thoughts?
POST: So I've been thinking lately (dangerous stuff) that we should remove age restrictions and instead replace them with education restrictions. First, let me say that I don't believe in big government at all, but it's a reality in our world and I don't see a way for there to be a successful country with little government or a complete lack there of. I don't want to argue this point because government and opinions on it are entirely subjective and if you don't agree with me than that's chill but I'd rather focus on the topic at hand.

My idea basically works like this, in order for you to drive a car you'd have to be 15/16 depending on what the state allows, but instead of waiting until you're 18 to have your restrictions removed (driving past 12am for example) you'd just wait until you graduate high school, the same thing would go or cigarettes, a credit card, or anything that requires you to be 18 years of age, in essence a HS diploma/GED would be the equivalent to being 18 years old in our current system.

To take this further, the government could enforce a law that states you need an associates, or two years of formal education at a higher level institution to be granted access to restrictions that are 21+. So if you wanted to drink alcohol for example you'd have to attend college for two years and have something to show for it; proof of enrollment with the goal of a four year degree or an associates degree. If per chance you never ended up getting your degree the two years of higher education would simply be enough to continue enjoying the perks of being 21+ in our current system. 

Ultimately, I think this is a much better system because it really makes education an even bigger factor in our lives and even if you hate committing the two years to college so you can buy alcohol then at least you got some knowledge and knowledge is pretty cool and useful. 

does this sound feasible? Or is this just crazy talk?

POST: - GF hates her job and doesn't make great money
- GF pays rent month to month. Can easily move in with me
- Jokes she wants to work for me. I know she really does

- I run my own business and work from home
- I make about 5x her salary
- I love having her company

All that considered, we've been seeing each other about 3 months. We hit it off great, have been on a nice vacation, and my family already loves this girl. She's basically been living at my place the past month, and it's been amazing. Endless sex, home cooking, and having a clean place. 

Here's my question. Is it weird for a couple to move in together with a low expectation of long term success? I feel like people usually move in with the person they think is ""the one"".

Do people ever say, ""we should move in for 6 months, and re-evaluate what we want from each other""? I feel like I can give her a much better job, valuable skills, and help her be financially independent which I know she really wants. I'm happy to let her live with me free, so expenses aren't really an issue.

From the very first moments after we met, I thought about her as 'something more'. And indeed, it was 'something more'. I invited her to my place a couple of days ago, a day after she invited me. We had an amazing night (no sex, though.). We were kissing and I told her that I love her. She agreed, told me the same thing after a minute or so. I am dead sure that she is in love with me, I just feel it. And she feels that way too.

But my question is: was I too fast to confess her such things? Should  I take it slow? Is it any rule that concerns time after you can tell another person that you are in love with him or her? Of course not. I don't want to play those dating games, like 'I am permitted to tell her that I love her at least 3 months after we met, I am not gonna tell her this now!' and so on. Both me and her are very compatible, she told me that she cares about me and don't want to lose me as someone who is nearby. She didn't change her behaviour after I told her that, just the opposite.

TITLE: TIFU By thinking a picture was actually Reddit
POST: So I only discovered Reddit a few months ago, although I'd heard about it for years, I had feared the impending addiction, as oft happens to me when I discover a new website, so I abstained, until recently.

You can all remember when you first arrived here, it can be confusing, well, it was for me. And took a good ~~week~~ month of casual browsing to start to get to grips with everything, and trust me I'm still not there.

So anyway, since, in a moment of ill-gotten self belief that I can somehow fix computers when the power socket on my laptop had finally divorced all lust for the jack on the charger, and I took it apart piece by piece, until all that was left was dust, I have been forced to use my SO's bright pink tablet to peruse the web.

Now, about three weeks ago, whenever I opened Reddit (usually as soon as she goes to bed, or when the soaps are on), there is a prompt to switch to 'mobile theme'. I tried it once, but as I had only just got used to the desktop format, I really couldn't be arsed re-learning.

So in the last few days I'd discovered more things like 'save' and such (I know, I know, but give a guy a break, I'm 42, not as tech savvy as you young whippersnappers) and found that because I was using the desktop version on a tablet, things weren't conforming properly, so I decided to find an app.

Went to Google play, clicked on the first app that came up and checked out the screenshots.

This is the FU.

I got into the [screenshot] so much that I forgot it was a screenshot and thought it was Reddit, and hence, when I wanted to find out how to bandage a finger without it turning round, and the screen was non responsive, I started cursing my GF's tablet and tapping the screen like a petulant child trying to get any thread to open, until I must have swiped, and it took me to another screenshot to the right.

At which point I felt like a proper fucking idiot.

TITLE: Atheist redditors with religious families: how/when did you tell them? What was the aftermath like?
POST: Background: I was born and raised Catholic, and somewhere around the beginning of high school I began the downwards slide from Catholic to sort of vaguely Christian to agnostic to atheist. However, I've held off on telling my family (mom's side is catholic, dad's side is methodist, everyone is pretty religious). I'm not too worried about my parents' reactions, since they're A) pretty chill in most regards and B) my parents. However, I'm hesitant to ""come out of the closet"", as it were, because I don't know how my extended family would react. I wish they had an atheist family friend so that I could see how they'd react to it (acceptance, attempts at conversion, firm belief that they're going to hell, etc), but I really have zero evidence on how my family would deal with atheists. I'm kind of planning on waiting until I'm living on my own to deal with it (freshman in college now) since I'd be more insulated from any bad fallout. Since there's obviously potential for quite a bit of conflict and it's not terribly hard to keep up the pretense that I'm Catholic, I'm inclined to just live with the status quo for now. On the other hand, I hate having to live out this fakeness, and would much rather everyone knew about and accepted my beliefs.

When things went down hill with me and her mom, I said things to the daughter about the mom that I shouldn't have.

I've sent her money to take her daughter on a flight and stay out in Monterey and visit the aquarium. She's so mad I'm not even sure if she plans on going.

I'm doing everything I can, sending flowers, saying I'm sorry, but it's almost like she thinks I don't mean it, or that I dont understand the gravity of the situation. I dont sleep at night I feel so much guilt, and if I do, I'm up at 4am in a cold sweet, turning over to see she's not there.

How do I make this right? I'll take however long, and spend every penny I have and write 1000's of apology notes if I have too.

Is there anything that would stand out to any parents our there to help make fix this or to move forward from it? I wont quit, it's just not who I am.

TITLE: Need advice for renting in the East Bay Area and my current savings plan
POST: Hey guys!

I am 27 years old and after some health issues and being unemployed, I now am living rent-free with family in the outer East Bay. I have lived with them for over a year and while they are happy to have me, I want a plan to move out in the near future (next 6 months max).

I currently make almost exactly $100k gross (~5000 net monthly) with no medical benefits (contract worker). Since I have been living rent-free I have so far:

Paid off all debts. Contributing 10% pre tax to 403(b) with annual increase of 1-2%. Contributing $400/month to max out Roth IRA contributions . Putting $500/month into liquid savings for emergency fund. Pay $475/month for health insurance which will soon decrease when I get new insurance. I have about $200-300/month in other monthly bills.

Currently I have $10,000 in checking, $1500 in emergency funds, $5000 in 403(b), and about $2000 in my Roth IRA.

So what monthly rent should I look at for living in a place in Oakland with roommates?  My thoughts have been spending $1000-1500/month but since I have a dog and need a place with hardwood floors for allergies so this restricts me a bit. Should I go higher if need be or stay at my current parameter? And am I on a good track savings wise?

TITLE: Me 18/M talking to 19/F, am I overthinking things after our first date?
POST: So for the past week and a half almost I've been talking to this girl I met online, things are going great and we talk daily and we shared great conversations, have a lot of similar interests and views, and its going pretty fast it seems, which neither of us have a problem with. We kind of talked like we've known each other for years and just clicked really well with each other, and had not issues with being very open about questions asked.She seemed really awesome and caring, and are both comfortable with meeting within a week. 

We have our first date yesterday, on Friday... I picked her up, we go back to my place, cuddle for a bit, watch a few movies, and I realized she was really what she seemed like. One thing led to another, then after things happened I took her back to her dorm. (I asked her about dating cause we both seem very interested in it, and she wanted to give it another date or 2 before making it official)

After I dropped her off, she told me to stay calm and not overthink things (she picked up real fast that I do), so I agree, and to text her when I get home, so I do, we talk a bit and we go to sleep after.

Now it is Saturday, I was aware that she was going to be busy with her family, and then drinking later in the night, and warned me that I shouldn't text her cause her responses wouldn't be appropriate and wanted to keep a good image in front of me (I didn't really care if she did or not), so I just shot her a good morning text around 9 in the morning, and then I went on with my day. It got around to 6 in the evening and I haven't heard anything, so I decide to text her, I get a response, we talk for a bit, and now nothing.

So my question is, am I overthinking things and should I be worried or should I just remain calm and let things play out and hope that Friday night wasn't just a one-night stand kind of thing? If I am overthinking things, what is a good way to distract myself from doing so that I don't worry and bother anyone with it?

TITLE: [AZ] Landlord sold me a lease for an apt with a cable hookup, the wiring was a dummy and they won't fix
POST: About a week and a half ago I signed a lease for an apartment in this current complex after having toured the complex twice, and I even inspected my actual apartment before signing the lease. Once I signed the lease, they told me to call my local ISP to have my coaxial cable jack activated so my own modem and router would start working.

After a few back and forth phone calls over a day or two with the ISP, I eventually followed the wiring through my apartment and noticed that it had actually been cut. Although the wire ended in a coax cable jack in my wall, and was visibly displayed and promised to be working, the wiring did not go anywhere.

I called apt management and they told me this was not a problem, that all the ISP had to do was drill new wiring into the apartment. 

Finally the ISP man came to do just that, but was denied access by management because he couldn't provide 'panduit' or 'conduit' or some kind of paneling that ran on the outside of the house.

ISP tells me they have never provided this service, but MANAGEMENT tells me it's in their contract with the ISP. This has now been going on for over a week, and I've been tethered to my phone's hotspot on my gaming desktop, while still paying the ISP for services I am not receiving. Last call recently I was told apartment ownership is looking at getting their own attorneys involved to force the ISP into action.

I do not have time for legal proceedings! I feel like I deserve accomodation while this matter is settled, and I shouldn't have to wait *weeks* for this to be resolved.

Can I refuse to pay rent, can I report them to an agency? Do I have to pay a lawyer a couple hundred bucks for a fancy letter?

TITLE: Road Trip Rage
POST: A couple years ago my boyfriend and I took an awesome roadtrip from San Francisco to Seattle up Highway 1. Highway 1 is a really fun drive with lots of great scenery but in many places it is only 1 lane each way and can be very winding in places. Add in a terrifying amount of fog and you may see where this story is going.

Somewhere before we hit Oregon but after the Redwoods we got stuck behind a white VW Cabrio doing 5-10 miles under the speed limit. Sure there were dotted lines for passing but between traffic coming the other direction and limited visibility it seemed we would never get past. The line of cars went from 2 to 3 to 6 to 7. But at no point did we lose civility. There was no honking or tailgating or flashing of lights, we suffered in silence.

Finally, there was a big sign ""slow traffic pull over in 1/4 mile"" With a great sigh of relief we began to anticipate our freedom. Sure enough in 1/4 mile a pull out lane appeared on the right, the perfect opportunity for someone who doesn't feel comfortable going too fast to pull over and make room. We had seen it many times before, especially families in rented RVs, would pull over and we'd give a courtesy wave and pass by. But no, not this time, not this car. The Cabrio was either too dead set on carrying on or just totally clueless at the growing ranks of cars stuck behind them to bother pulling over and letting everyone pass. Demoralized and frustrated we continued to watch the motorcade grow to 13 vehicles trapped behind the evil white Cabrio. Several dotted passing lines came and went along with many gestures of exasperation from the drivers behind us.  It seemed fate was not on our side this day until finally our moment came:

Wide open, clear visibility, straight road with a dotted line.

TITLE: Road Trip Rage
POST: A couple years ago my boyfriend and I took an awesome roadtrip from San Francisco to Seattle up Highway 1. Highway 1 is a really fun drive with lots of great scenery but in many places it is only 1 lane each way and can be very winding in places. Add in a terrifying amount of fog and you may see where this story is going.

Somewhere before we hit Oregon but after the Redwoods we got stuck behind a white VW Cabrio doing 5-10 miles under the speed limit. Sure there were dotted lines for passing but between traffic coming the other direction and limited visibility it seemed we would never get past. The line of cars went from 2 to 3 to 6 to 7. But at no point did we lose civility. There was no honking or tailgating or flashing of lights, we suffered in silence.

Finally, there was a big sign ""slow traffic pull over in 1/4 mile"" With a great sigh of relief we began to anticipate our freedom. Sure enough in 1/4 mile a pull out lane appeared on the right, the perfect opportunity for someone who doesn't feel comfortable going too fast to pull over and make room. We had seen it many times before, especially families in rented RVs, would pull over and we'd give a courtesy wave and pass by. But no, not this time, not this car. The Cabrio was either too dead set on carrying on or just totally clueless at the growing ranks of cars stuck behind them to bother pulling over and letting everyone pass. Demoralized and frustrated we continued to watch the motorcade grow to 13 vehicles trapped behind the evil white Cabrio. Several dotted passing lines came and went along with many gestures of exasperation from the drivers behind us.  It seemed fate was not on our side this day until finally our moment came:

Wide open, clear visibility, straight road with a dotted line. We veer to the left and pin the throttle, open the windows and stick our fists out the window making bull horns as we rocket past the Cabrio. Much to our glee the next 3 cars behind us follow suit, also sticking their fists out the window as they pass.

TITLE: Communication is difficult between me [34M] and my girlfriend [29F] of 6 months
POST: I feel like I'm learning not to talk to my girlfriend, or rather I'm learning to talk to her as little as possible. This is because I feel like her responses are never nice. She is constantly either argumentative, pat, dismissive, defensive, or a mix of all of them. I am not getting what I need: empathy, attempts at understanding, the benefit of the doubt, compassion, compromise. The compromise I do get comes with something that feels like resentment, manifested with an attitude of ""let's just get through this"".

Example: I'm kind of into board games and I asked her if she wanted to play one with me. She paused and said ""sure"". I let her pick one, we started playing, and she was in a shit mood the whole time. I hope it's understandable that this makes it hard for me to enjoy it. I asked her gently what was up and whether she was having fun. She said ""as much as last time"". She wouldn't make eye contact with me the whole time without giving me a ""what?!"" face, and she was stoic and nearly silent the whole time. I was glad when the game was over. I would have ended it early but that would have escalated the situation so I just kept my enjoyment face on and hammered it out so we could move on. I don't know why she couldn't just say she wasn't into it.

Most of our conversation seems to include parts wherein one of us is correcting the other or disagreeing without signs of listening. I've noticed this and I'm trying to adjust my communication, but it seems like the only ""constructive"" thing I've been able to do is to interact less and less. She seems to get way emotional very quickly and it raises the stakes on the simplest of conversations. Stuff like which car to drive and what to eat for dinner have me on edge, and it feels like any conversation where we have differing opinions needs to be resolved or avoided as quickly as possible because of how emotionally charged it will inevitably get.

I'm concerned that this is my fault and I need to understand what I can do better.

I noticed it was a different username than the one he normally uses. I searched it later that day and he's made a bunch of posts on r/dirtypenpals (a NSFW subreddit; it's basically a bunch of people looking to talk dirty online/send nude Snapchats/whatever). He's been asking to roleplay scenarios, message girls, asking for kiks/snapchats, and just talking about different sexual fetishes.

I know his passwords so I logged in as him. He had over 50 messages in his inbox: nudes, Snapchats, kiks, dirty messages. He even made a separate Snapchat username.

I am devastated. We have had a very happy, healthy relationship and our sex life is not lacking in quality or quantity. We're both college students and we spend plenty of time together; I have never been worried about anything like this before. He has also never communicated any of these sexual desires to me before and I am wondering why.

TITLE: Me[18M] with my 'girlfriend' [19F] on/off 7 months, she's indecisive about being public
POST: Hello everybody, thanks for reading, I'm in a really tough spot right now. Be blunt and brutally honest if necessary.

This girl I've been on/off with is somebody I've loved for a very long time, she was my best friend for 3 years before I finally swept her off her feet. She's my first love and I'd do anything for her. Problem is, when I 'broke the friend zone' she was in a relationship. We agreed not to do anything until she broke up with him, so when she did I thought we would be able to be together.

What happened instead is the relationship has gotten really complicated. I know she loves me based on how she acts around me, but she doesn't want to be public about the relationship at all. She is to certain people, but when it comes to her family and her close friends, nobody knows about us. I find this frustrating, but I ignore it because I love her and I want her to be happy.

I feel like we should be able to be more public now, but she's afraid of being judged because the guy she used to be with was very popular amongst her family, despite making her unhappy. 

Myself and her are serious, we've had sex and we try to have a date or two per week with each other, and we talk almost every day. I want to be able to transition smoothly for her to being more public about our relationship, without making her feel like I'm forcing her to.
 Even if this requires rebuilding the relationship or something like that. I just don't know where to start, which is why I made this account and this thread.

 Thanks in advance for the help.

POST: I'm fairly happy with my girlfriend, but ever since the beginning it's felt like I haven't had the same effort reciprocated back to me when it comes to sex. She's a very shy person and I always just assumed it would get better as she came out of her shell. It honestly has gotten worse. 

I always initiate, which I'm usually fine with, but it'd just be nice to feel wanted like that sometimes. It makes me feel like I'm more attracted to her than she is to me. When she says she's tired I offer to do the work and just let her relax, but if I say I'm tired we just don't do anything. We also almost never have sex more than once in a day. We've done it twice maybe 2-3 times, but we've never had those all day or all night events that should happen in passionate relationships (in my opinion). 

I'm also a very sexually adventurous person, where as she can be very vanilla in the bedroom, claiming to have to no kinks. Which kind of discourages me to bring up mine. We have handcuffs and toys that we buy, then use once or twice and then they just gather dust. 

We've both talked and fought about this and things will change on either side for a little bit and then it just goes back to normal. I don't want to break up but it feels like that's the direction we're headed in. Is there a different way I should approach her with this?

I never cared that it made me look like a bratty, immature spiteful 'hater', but at this point in my life, I just am tired of it eating my soul away. I feel like it brings me so much unhappiness.

I can hardly be happy for other people's accomplishments because I feel worthless in comparison, so I guess I try to appease myself by being a total prick about it. I hate seeing other people have nice things, especially when I feel like they never have to work for them, it's literally, just handed to them. But really, what I find most disturbing and yet unshakable in me, is how I envy *people's happiness*. I feel like a vampire.

TITLE: I (21 M) have been on a couple dates with a girl (22 F) that I went to college with. I could see myself marrying this girl. I'm wondering how long my fellow Redditors spent courting their significant others.
POST: So this girl, we'll call her ""Maya"", went to the same college I did. We kissed a couple of times in college, and would always dance when we saw each other out at the bar. But Maya and I were never anything more than that. 

About six months after we graduated, I decided to ask Maya on a date. She said yes, and we had an awesome evening together cooking dinner at her apartment. We went on one more date after that. Since then, she has cancelled a couple of would-be dates we had made due to scheduling conflicts. 

Normally, I wouldn't deal with that. My general rule is that if a girl cancels on me twice, I move on. But it's different with Maya. I think her excuses for cancelling were legitimate, and as I said, I have a major thing for her. 

But I also think Maya is using the cancellations to figure out how much effort I'm willing to put in to dating her. It sounds stupid, but she knows she's a quality girl. She's never slept around, she's kind, she's funny, and is generally a great person. She wants to make sure I'm for real before she lets her walls down. 

So my question to you, Reddit, is this -- how long did you spend courting the person you knew was the one for you? It's a strange feeling for me to continue to pursue a person after they have broken two dates. I'm curious about you all's experience with situations like this.

TITLE: TIFU by destroying the lawn mower
POST: So this happened about 10 years ago, when I [22M] was a little 12 year old shithead.

I was instructed by my stepmother to mow the lawns. Apparently 5 inches high on a country property in AUS is TOO LONG.

It was 40 degrees celcius and I was sweating like crazy. I immediately tried to argue this 'order' from the dragon to which I received: ""Mow the fucking lawns!"" Righto bitch-tits, let me die in the heat then.
So away I went, filled up the ride-on mower with petrol, checked the oil, chucked on my ipod with mufflers over the top to protect my little ears.

Well I thought I broke the Australian speed mowing record that day, riding the mower up towards the house, all I could think about was how good a job I had done.

Little did I know that I was heading for a new garden bed that had been put in between the house and me. Well I just drove straight over this wood and steel built side of the garden, obliterated the new plants, and bent the blades to shit. The blades went up through the motor belt and chassis of the mower, then broke off and straight into the motor.

This was not a good move, as my dad and stepmum saw the whole thing. 
The next thing I remember was the mower catching on fire, dad running to get the fire extinguisher and my stepmum screaming: "" YOU FUCKING IDIOT, YOU ARE THE WORST FUCKING CHILD ON THE EARTH"".

I got grounded for like a year, and basically verbally abused for the next month about how much of a disgusting piece of shit I was.

TITLE: (CAN) Can a ""college experience"" justify a more expensive university?
POST: Throwaway for privacy. I will try to keep this brief.

My financial situation: Senior in high school, ~$4,000 in savings, no current job, RESP from parents worth ~$20,000, upper middle class with parents probably earning ~$200,000+ a year (not sure exact salary).

I am currently applying for universities, and though I will apply to several, I'm really only going to probably choose between two. University A being more prestigious (one of the top universities in Canada). University B is slightly less acclaimed, though still respectable, and cheaper. With this university there is also the guarantee of a sizeable ($10,000+) scholarship directly dependant on my grades. There's a chart on their website that X grade = X scholarship. 

The problem is this: The reason university B is so much cheaper is that I will not be living on campus. It will take ~30 minutes by bus to get there, versus 1.5 hours for university A. The tuition itself is only slightly less, but adding the cost of a mandatory food plan and a room makes university A about ~$18,000 per year versus maybe $8,000 for university B.

At this point in my life I feel very ready to get a little more independence and live on my own. University A also has a very specialized and acclaimed first year program that I'm very interested in. My parents have said that they will help me a lot, but they're certainly not going to go into massive debt for me, nor would I want them to. I'm not planning on getting a car, the university pays for a free transit pass, and I'm not the type to spend a lot on clothes or booze. I'm willing to work throughout my first and second year and during the summer, and my program has co-op opportunites. I will probably accrue some loans, but probably not a lot. For what it's worth Canada has recently announced that student loans no longer need to be paid until I'm making at least $25,000 a year, if that matters. What are your thoughts?

TITLE: I [23M] and a good friend of mine [20F] decided today that we want to get married.
POST: Before I begin, both I and my future wife are in Wisconsin, USA.

However, we are planning on this being only a temporary marriage. I'm gay and want kids and she, after having a rough childhood, wants stability and someone who can be at her side to help her into the future.

We were thinking about looking into a contract- a prenup of sorts that would lay the foundations of a temporary, 5 year marriage since that'd be plenty of time to have kids while providing her the stability to finish up college. We were looking to define the terms within a context of a prenup- near-separate finances only share the costs of living that affect us both while also helping to take care of the kids. As for the children, we were looking to defining the terms of custody with the terms being something comparable to every other week.

Ultimately, we plan on the marriage being fairly open and we are only intending it to last 5 years with a divorce that will hopefully be as clean cut as possible.

So with all of this in mind, what, if any, legal ramifications do we need to be prepared for? (We're in the US btw) How would we go about establishing this contract and how effective would it be in a divorce? We still intend to be in each others' lives as friends and may even share a house or a duplex so that the kids can be around us.

And finally, what would be the best way to go about explaining this to our families? Has this kind of thing been done before and is there has there been any research looking into the total effect of such a marriage?

TITLE: Me [23F] with my dad [40 something M], contacting him after he left my mom [42F] when he found out she was pregnant.
POST: Hello,

So, a couple of weeks back, I had to rush my mom to the hospital and we started talking about the families that we saw in the emergency room and she told me in passing that I should get in contact with my dad. 

 

Now, my dad left my mom when they were 19 years old and found out that she was pregnant with me. Turns out that his family doesn't approve of her since she's not a doctor while his whole family is and my mom raised me by herself. In my 23 years of experience, I've never met him once. Although, every few years he tries to get into contact with me, the most ""recent"" was 8-9 years ago when he went to my grandmother's house and hoped that I was there.

 

Anyway, I shelved the idea of meeting him cause I was lazy to look for him but I came across his dad's contact details when I was looking for a doctor to have my injury assessed. 

 

When I saw the details, I decided to do a full person search then I came across his SIL and brother's Facebook accounts (I don't think he has cause I've been looking non stop and I've gotten nowhere. I even thought he's already dead but apparently he's still alive based on his SIL's pictures). I asked my mom if I should contact him; she said yes but asked me for what purpose and also wanted me to be ready for the consequences. I told her that I just want to meet him. For closure perhaps? but honestly, I don't feel empty not knowing him. Just incredibly curious.

 

So reddit, do you think I should contact him and invite him for coffee to get to know him or would it be better if I don't and forget about him for the rest of my life?

 

Thank you so much

In Britain, the measures our government is taking is meant to reduce the deficit over 5 years. However, in 5 years all kinds of ideas can be introduced as a means to end deficit, no matter how crazy it might sound. And once in place it becomes legitimized by the deficit.

It got me thinking that a deficit is a perfect boogeyman. It is intangible, can't be touched, can't be seen. It can be used to excuse any sort of behaviour.

In Britain, the measures our government is taking is meant to reduce the deficit over 5 years. However, in 5 years all kinds of ideas can be introduced as a means to end deficit, no matter how crazy it might sound. And once in place it becomes legitimized by the deficit.

POST: I am certainly no expert on economics or politics. I have a grasp that i would say is better than the layman, and I am literate in these areas; there are concepts that I understand and I enjoy learning more about them but something has struck me and horrified me in turn. It is leaning towards conspiracy theory, a term I don't like as it has so many negative connotations, but its an apt term, and I realise how insane my idea might sound.

Would you put it past the government, or any group of people in power, to orchestrate a credit crunch? I mean, from my basic understanding the credit crunch didn't just appear out of thin air; it was caused by a slow erosion. If the media were to uncover the conspiracy that the credit crunch was orchestrated with a deficit in mind, would you believe this?

TITLE: I [25m] want to buy my GF [27F] a gift as a congratulations for getting in to grad school. Am I overstepping?
POST: Hi Reddit -

  
I'll try to keep this short. So , my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year, and lately she has just been super not into her job and wants to change careers. To do this, she has to go through a masters program. She's not where she wants to be financially, and this has really been stressing her out.  This has been accelerated recently because she needs to get a computer to do her online work. I told her she could use mine, but I know that she really just needs her own.

She found one the other day that was a really good deal, but she didnt pull the trigger because of the money. I was really tempted to just say screw it and buy it, but I didn't want to come off as condescending. She does not like having to rely on other people for her success.
  
I on the other hand, am relatively successful for my age (Software Engineer at a large company right out of college), and financially I am in a very good spot. The few hundred bucks is not a big deal to me, and if it means she would be less stressed over the purchase of this computer - I would be happy to help her out.  
  
I'm considering going out and just picking it up today and saying congratulations for getting in to school, I hope this helps you achieve your goals.  
  
Would this come off as condescending? I am only trying to be helpful.

Thanks Reddit!

After a long conversation, a lot of promises, and he asked my dad, I said yes. One of the first promises he made was to get me a different ring. He told me this in his proposal, so please don't think I only said yes, if I got a new ring. His grandmother's ring is beautiful, I'll keep it forever, but it isn't either of our style. 

Fast forward 2.5 months and there is still no ring. We have one picked out, it's exactly what I want, and HUGE plus, it's $1200 UNDER the budget he set.

Other than this, he has up held all his other promises, and our relationship is going really well. Our communication is back to par, and the arguing is very minimal. 

We have a date set for next March, and all the plans are made. He is completely on board with everything. 

However, I want a ring. It means a lot to me. It's a symbol of our love, our commitment, and our future. Am I asking too much from him? Should I just be happy we're doing so much better, and we're on a path for a successful future?

Now if anything is wrong he tells me I am being silly and if the timing is right he blames it on my period.

He used to be so sweet and understanding and he always wanted to hang out. Now whenever we are together he just plays video games. He acts like it's a chore to cuddle with me. He won't even hold me when we sleep together anymore. Kisses seem like a nuisance, too. But he is always up for sex. 

I've tried everything. I've bought him gifts, cooked things for him, I never say no to anything he wants to do even if it doesn't interest me, I try to talk to him, and I've made it very clear that I like being physical through actions other than sex. 

He never smiles anymore unless we are with friends or he has been drinking. But as soon as we are away from friends he gets quiet again. He keeps saying he loves me, but it's not enough.

I don't know what to do. I've sold everything of value, applied for every job possible and now I just feel like a worthless being to my BF. If only money grew on trees. Any and all advice, ideas and help would be much appreciated. My brain is fried from all these job applications.

TITLE: My childhood friend is squatting in a shed. How do I help him?
POST: My childhood friend (23 M) (we'll call him Lyle) has led quite the troubled life. His mother was a drug addict who dropped him as a baby. He needed surgery afterwards and his elderly great aunt and uncle sued his mother (their great niece) for custody of him. His mother moved into the home with her uncle and aunt and Lyle some years before passing away of a drug overdose when he was 15.
 His uncle passed away when he was 20 and his aunt was placed in a palliative care unit as she was unwell thus leaving Lyle alone in the world. 

This is where he starts making really poor choices. He ruined the grandparent's house by letting his deadbeat friends run rampant in it. He let them drive his uncle's car, (left to Lyle in the uncle's will) which they totaled. Eventually a family friend who was appointed by his great aunt as power of attorney intervened and evicted him from the aunt's house in order to fix it up and sell it. 
Lyle moved into a place in the seediest part of the city with some people he claimed were gang members. He had a falling out with them and last I heard he was squatting in the shed behind his (currently unoccupied) aunt and uncle's house. 

He tried to live with the family friend with power of attorney, but they had a fight and he was kicked out. I've heard rumors that Lyle gambles, stole money from his sick grandmother, and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia (I don't necessarily believe this, he was always a weird kid and I could see a doctor who didn't know or understand him reading his peculiarities as symptoms) He's still working a pretty decent job right now...from the shed.
I grew up doing tae kwon do with this kid. I've known him for 15 years and it's really hard to see he's in such a bad place.  Short of taking him in myself what do you think I can do? Who should I call? Should I talk to him? What should I say? Our old Tae Kwon Do instructor can possibly help talk some sense into him.

TITLE: My (M33) wife (F44) of 14 years is in the mental health ward of the hospital for a week with severe depression and anxiety. We have been talking about divorce lately. She will be coming home soon and I don't know what to do.
POST: I have been dealing with a crumbling 14 year marriage for a few years now. This year has been a nightmare. In May, things came to a head when it came to light that she had been having an online affair with a childhood friend. After a big fight, she left and went to a hotel for the night. After stewing for a while I checked her laptop to try and track down where she went. That's when I came across the messages to her old friend. After tracking her down to the hotel and confronting her, she admitting to the texts and how she was hoping to meet up with him that night. It never happened and we tried to move on. She has a lot of resentment towards me for using and hiding pornography through out our marriage which she is very against. Partly because of our age difference we are on very different levels sexually. 

After the hotel event, things just got worse. We have stopped communicating as much as possible living in the same house and having kids together. Lots of fighting. Lots of sadness. She has been mentally unstable and said some scary cryptic things to her mom indicating she might hurt herself. So her mom took her to the doctors and they admitted her. She been there since Monday. 

When she gets home I have no idea what to expect. Things of course won't ever go back to being good again, we are too far past that. Just don't know if living together is even a possibility. Help.
TL;DR: "," How can you effectively communicate with your wife now that she has been admitted to the mental health ward?

3. What steps and strategies can you take to rebuild trust in your relationship after her online affair?"

TITLE: Me [28 F] trouble reading the signs/signals of unemotional man [30 M]
POST: I'm dating again after ending a three-year-long relationship a few months ago. Historically I've dated men who, for the most part, have been on the emotional and communicative side, which has relieved a lot of the typical anxiety around the questions of ""where do I stand?"", ""how does he feel about me?"", etc. 

I recently started dating a man who, for lack of a better term, checks a lot of my boxes, but who has yet to clue me in on even a sliver of what's going on inside his head. This is a challenge for me because I hate to make assumptions or read between the lines, which are skills that I don't think I've ever developed a proficiency for given my dating history. However, he has initiated spending time together, physical contact, and checks in with texts regularly, so I do my best to balance his actions with his (lack of) words.

As a rule, I try to avoid hurting feelings, but I'm afraid I will given how hard this man is to read. For example, I left late instead of staying the night because he never made it clear that's what he wanted. Once it was clear I was leaving, I sensed that he thought I was staying and saw on his face that he was disappointed. While I know some of these awkward miscommunications are unavoidable, I'd like to prevent them as much as possible.

So, given my personality, would it be best to take this as a lesson learned and stick to dating more emotionally expressive and open guys, or is there a good strategy to understanding actions instead of relying on words? I'm guessing there's a decent chance that he may open up in the future once he trusts me enough to be vulnerable, but I'm more concerned with the getting-to-that-point.

Firstly the teachers involved were informed of refusal by counselors of International Educational Programs Council. They have been asked to discontinue planning this event due to the anti gay relations in Russia.

He didn't like my decision because i didn't ask his opinion, nor does he like the (girl)friend I'd be moving in with.

I chose it because it will be cheaper, a different experience etc. I didn't consult him because I didn't think it had anything to do with him. He's not the one that has to live down here. 

He then says i ""don't really give a shit"" about him because i didn't consult him first. He always does this. If I make a decision he doesn't like, somehow it means i don't care for him. He says I don't make decisions as a couple. And i tell him it shouldn't concern him where I stay. Then he says (this is may favourite part) ""I wanted you to put me first like a couple should"". 

Then It just goes back an fourth, him- accusing me of not caring about his opinion/me not caring about him, and me- not understanding how/why me moving means this.

He was a genius, nice to everyone he came across, yet always came off as cocky. There was never a moment he missed to prove he was superior to somebody. The closer we became the more we integrated into each other's group of friends. We soon began to have petty arguments and fight over stupid things. I could never win an argument against this guy. When I did win an argument providing proof of something I was correct the entire time, he would become angry (at times wanted to start a brawl) and not speak to me. He knew my empathy would then cause me to apologize and he took pleasure in the fact. Things took a turn for the worst when in high school he had sex with one of my ex-girlfriends. This did not bother me one bit to be honest, due to the fact this girl had cheated on me. (I was initially hurt but it's highschool so I got over it fairly quickly) I blew it off and actually bro'd out with him about it, but then began to see his true colors. There was a point where he caught me having a casual conversation with his girlfriend (we were in high school marching band) and he was not going to let that pass. He literally turned our friends against me for about a solid week until I apologized and thoroughly explained what happened; again my empathy kicking in. I inherently thought the whole thing was my fault, similar to many other arguments we had had in the past; it was ALWAYS my fault. 

Fast forward a few years. I'm 20 now and we went to different colleges but still texted everyday, played Xbox online on the weekends and went to concerts and hung out during holidays. Somehow through all this disconnection he would still manage to undermine me in more ways than one. (We both began working out at uni so you can see how that went) Until one late day, I finally learned what a sociopath was and discovered how to deal with one.

Step 1) Cut off all contact.

POST: Okay, so my boyfriend VERY rarely gives me compliments.

 Only on rare special occasions does he so much as say ""You look nice"". We've been officially dating for 4 months and 'unofficially' on/off for 10 months and in that time he has only complimented me a handful of times, even though I compliment him daily (appearance, personality,skills, etc). 

He says that giving/ receiving compliments make him feel unconformable and I don't want to pressure him to do something he feels uncomfortable with but it does concern me.

 He also recently told me he loves me after a night of drinking and now when I say it he replies with ""you too"" or tells me I'm going to wear it out.

 I don't want to come off as needy or self-centered or anything. I just can't help but feel worried maybe he didn't mean what he said... what do you guys think???

POST: I know this is going to seem so selfish but I don't know what it is. It's going to be my birthday in a few days. And my bf bought my an LG 50 inch 4k resolution t.v. I felt really touched by the fact that he decided to buy me something at all. But I hate that he gets me so many expensive things. For Christmas he got me a ps4. And he's telling me he wants to build me a good gaming computer from scratch. All these gifts are overwhelming me. I don't know why it hurts so much. I'm so upset. I didn't need a new t.v. I loved my old one more than anything. I didn't ask for an upgrade!!! Some of you might not understand and I know I should feel lucky. I am appreciative. But I don't know why he spends so much money on me,  especially on things that aren't broken and I don't need. I feel so useless I can't even look or touch the stupid t.v. It makes me emotions feel so uncomfortable. I miss my old t.v. But he installed the new t.v. In my room when I wasn't home and took my old t.v. even though my old one was 28 inches it was the perfect size for my tiny room. My room is literally really small. And i told him I miss my old tv. That why did he spend so much money on something I didn't need. And he got really sad and he said he wants me to have the best of the best. We got into a fight last night because I told him I dislike him buying so many things when he could be using that money for his future. And he got mad and he said he'll return the stupid t.v. I feel so bad. I don't know why this even happening.

POST: For the past few weeks, I've been casually dating a guy I met on Tinder. We've been on two dates, spanning a week apart. So, we first started talking to each other about a month ago.

He lives very far away from me (35 miles), and has driven up for these dates, which he offered. I told him I felt bad about this (I don't have a car at the moment, long story), and would offer him gas money. He sidestepped the question, and was like, ""no worries, when can I see you again?"" I have continually asked him if he is okay with this, and he just shrugs.

We don't really have that much in common, honestly, but he's pleasant to talk to. We haven't done anything intimate yet. He hasn't really even tried to make any moves.

We text a lot, usually prompted by him as well, asking me how my day went, what am I thinking about, etc. He asked if he could call me today, so I thought we were going to have some big talk, like, ""let's end this"" or something.

He called me to ask about when we could get together again, and we planned to go to a comedy show next week. I tried to get him to talk more, but he was like, ""Oh, I didn't really have anything else to say. I just thought it would be better if we planned this out over the phone, instead of text.""

POST: My (20 f) now ex (20m) that I dated for about a year and a half broke up today. The topic we had fights about were fixable but there was one thing that was bad. He said that the two of us can't have a good conversation together because he doesn't know what to talk about with me. He kept saying I love music but he loves football and is indifferent about music. I am same with football. Then he asked me what he wants me to talk about to which I said I can't just tell him to talk about such and such topics. We kept discussing and finally he said this will be a problem and that he feels like ""we both will be happy with someone else"". At the end, before I left, he also said that some years from now he will realize that he made the biggest mistake. I didn't say anything because before he kept saying we'll be happier with someone else. It hurt to stay there longer. I also told him never to contact me again and blocked him from everything. I really loved him. 

We're in college and have classes together and I dont know how to face him or other friends in my class who loved talking about us and some who considered us ""that couple"". He said he loved every thing about me but he just can't see us together in the long run if he can't talk to me about things.

I am just kind of lost. I have friends I can hang out with but I just want to stay alone and think about what could've been fixed but I dont know if he feels the same way. How do I feel better?

POST: Hey guys. Throwaway, obviously.

I've always felt like I was eventually going to be really awesome. I still have this belief and feel like I'm going to totally get over this stuff at some point. However, I feel like I'm currently at a place in my life where I'm ""worse than"" most other people, or at least more miserable or something. This is mostly centered around my total lack of relationship success (a couple of random hookups at college don't count), and I feel like once I get that shit sorted out I'll be a much happier and successful person and I'll have finally reached the point in my life where I think everything is sorted out as it should be.

I think part of the problem is that I have this constantly desire to improve myself. This sounds like some bullshit that you might come up with to respond to a ""what is your greatest weakness?"" question in a job interview, but what it actually means is that I always end up feeling inadequate in some way. I have trouble accepting who I am and loving that person and instead just fantasize about how awesome I'll be in the future once I've acquired skill X or gotten over mental roadblock Y.

I see all the time posted on here that first you must love yourself if you want someone to love you. This makes sense (and I also want to have better self-esteem and self-confidence for my own reasons). I think sometimes I can have a negative energy to me, and I know that's not what I want to be radiating to people around me. The problem is that I don't know how to do this.

TITLE: [29/m] GF of 2 years (26/f) found some old saved reddit links she didn't like on my account.
POST: So, I decided to come here and post this because I'm just not sure how I should feel about it.

My gf decided she wanted to see what reddit was all about while using my laptop (which I normally never leave home) to print some stuff. She was looking for something similar to ""favorites"" to see what it was I liked and she ended up on my page of saved links. The first page had nothing bad on it but on the next page, there were maybe about 5-6 links. 3or 4 of these links were NSFW kind of links that I had saved probably 7 or so months ago, when I was brand new to reddit. I had forgotten about them and hadn't looked at them since I saved them.

We've been together 2 years, and the issue of me looking at porn has come up once or twice, but we've never fully discussed it. I disagree with her view that if you are with someone, you shouldn't masturbate anymore. 

We also have an ongoing with our sex life, in which we basically don't have one. This issue is one I'm not sure of the reasoning for. I've only had one other serious relationship and she was more aggressive and would get tired of waiting and would turn me on to get what she wanted. On top of that, the sex with my last gf worked better. I am an overweight guy (and she is somewhat too) and it really limits what we can even do. I think this is a big issue for me as it ends up being me doing all the hard work and it's quite exhausting and... yeah. 

I'd say I look at porn once a week, and I wonder if it does have an effect on my sex drive, but I'm honestly not sure. What I'm really looking for here is, should I feel bad here? Should I be the one apologizing? I understand why finding this would make her upset but at the same time I don't know how guilty I really feel. She is taking this very seriously and has left the house for now. What do you guys think? Feel free to ask any questions about anything I may have left out.

When he asks me if I find him attractive, I tell him that I do because his self-esteem is bad enough as it is, and of course I wouldn't want to hurt him. 

However, this is getting in the way of intimacy (at least, for me) because I don't find him physically attractive when it comes to sexual intercourse/the like. Whenever he asks me if something's wrong because he feels that I'm not ""into it,"" I lie and tell him everything is fine. But recently it's just not cutting it for me.

POST: A good female friend of mine, whom I helped recover from drug addiction, and helped get her out of an emotional rut, is acting very strange towards me lately. She is currently in a relationship with a guy who is seemingly bipolar, hes either fantastic, or horrible. Half the time she is depressed about it, the other have cant stop talking about how great he is.

Anyway, about a month back she and I started hanging out a lot more. Just going out and doing stuff everyday, working out together, movies, hiking, etc. She has slept over at my current apartment 3 times. On the couch. In an average week we probably see each other 3-4 times, usually 4-8 hours each time. 

The friendship dynamic with this girl is strange, she has a boyfriend, I know she does. But she treats me like her boyfriend when we are in public, but in private, she treats me like a ""bro"".  

We decided that for both of us it would be beneficial to get an apartment and share it, 2bed 1bath. Beneficial in terms of finances. The other night we were browsing a Bed bath and beyond type store, when she grabbed my hand and held it romantically. Whilst this holding of the hand occurred, she showed me all the things WE should get in our apartment together, in OUR bathroom, just treating it like we were a couple moving in together.

Now I understand that he does not make that much money, and he never did. But I remember him saying months ago something like ""I spent $1,500 on my ex wife's ring, it was pretty cheap.""  And now a few days ago to me he said he would only spend between $600-700 for the ring.

At first I was very okay with it, and even looked at some cheaper rings since I do not care about money spent on stupid stuff in general, but I just remembered how much he spend on his ex wife and he even said it was an okay about of money to spend on a ring, but not okay for me. He made about $19,000 yr when when was with her, and with me he makes about $25,000 yr. (He switched jobs) 

It's not a lot at all I know, and I am okay with that...but he spent double on her, when he had less money, and even said that her ring price was no big deal, but mine is apparently. He has less debt now too while he is with me. 

Oh and he claims to like me way more than he ever did her, but I am not too sure now...What do you think? I just do not want to get married to the wrong guy, and I am not sure if this is a flag or not.

In the beginning of the year, when I met her, I really just saw her as a friend because I was completely blinded by another girl who ended up being a total bitch, but slowly I have come to realise how much I like her. We are very similar and spend all our time together, both in class and out of class. I have met her whole family and one would say that we have a really serious relationship, if we were in one. 

The only problem is that we are not in a relationship. I have never been in a relationship and have never kissed a girl before. She also told me that before this year she hadn't kissed anyone either. I really want to kiss her but I don't know how. Usually I have just been way too nervous to even think about it but with her I am completely relaxed and its not a problem. I just feel that its not part of my personality to do that, even though I really want to. I feel like I just cant get over the barrier of the first kiss. We have been more than just class buddies for about 2.5 months, and I met her in the beginning of February, about 4 months ago

TITLE: Girl [18/f] is perfect for me [18/m], but I don't know how to kiss her.
POST: I am an 18 year old guy, currently at university. There is a girl [18/f] who I am in class with, who has become a really good friend of mine. In the beginning of the year, when I met her, I really just saw her as a friend because I was completely blinded by another girl who ended up being a total bitch, but slowly I have come to realise how much I like her. We are very similar and spend all our time together, both in class and out of class. I have met her whole family and one would say that we have a really serious relationship, if we were in one. 

The only problem is that we are not in a relationship. I have never been in a relationship and have never kissed a girl before. She also told me that before this year she hadn't kissed anyone either. I really want to kiss her but I don't know how. Usually I have just been way too nervous to even think about it but with her I am completely relaxed and its not a problem. I just feel that its not part of my personality to do that, even though I really want to. I feel like I just cant get over the barrier of the first kiss. We have been more than just class buddies for about 2.5 months, and I met her in the beginning of February, about 4 months ago

I do not want to have to get drunk to kiss her for the first time and I wont really have a chance to do so because we are writing exams now anyway.

I really just need some help and guidance as to what to do.

TITLE: [22/f] I met this guy [22/m] that I like but I'm not ready for a relationship. What should I do?
POST: Well, he is also a Redditor so if he sees this.. Hi anh... (:

Anyways, I got out of a 3 1/2 year relationship 8 months ago because he lied to me often and talked to girls behind my back. I'm not sure if he cheated on me, but that is one thing I will never truly be sure of. 

I actually enjoyed every minute of being single. It is more relieving not having to worry about anyone else and I was taking the time to get my stuff together and figure out a few things about myself. Then this guy comes into my life. He knows that I am not ready for a relationship and is willing to wait for me. I know I'm not ready for a relationship because all the negative feelings of jealousy and inadequacy I had towards the end of my last relationship would come up when I see a girl had messaged him or texted him. No, I am not going through his stuff, sometimes he checks his stuff when I'm sitting right next to him and I sometimes happen to glance over. I really do try not to look though. 

We've known each other for a month but the connection we have is not like I have had with anyone else before. I know he is someone that I can be with but I can't do it now. I feel like if I get together with him now, I won't be able to give him all of me because of these negative emotions that I have to deal with because of my ex. It's not fair to him and it is a feeling that I would hate to put myself through again. What should I do?

POST: This post reminded me of my experience: 

Anyways, about a year ago my uncle gave me his old motor scooter.Tiny thing, might as well be on a pedal bike that can hit 40 mph. Anyways, I'm driving down one of the busy streets crossing one of 2 main streets running through my University. I was slowing down at the intersection because the light was red, but before I stopped, it turned green. Of course I accelerated, not thinking anything of it. It was cooler day, and my left hand was holding my hood tight so it wouldn't blow back.

I approached the now green-lit intersection, only to get a quarter of the way through it to hear a mini van honk at me. Of course I'm startled, doubly so since the freakin' thing is about to either hit me, or I was going to hit it. I swerved around the van and slid up on the seat a bit and hit my ribs on the handlebars. I looked back and realized the van either tried to beat the yellow light, or just wasn't paying attention. I was either going to be t-boned, or hit the side of the van, and flip over the hood. As bad as it is, I don't wear a helmet. I was so shaken up, realizing I likely would have smashed my head in to the pavement. Scary thought of what would have happened to me.

POST: Reddit, I am currently in a predicament.  A girl in my major (and every class with me until I graduate) has taken quite an interest in me since last spring semester.  She wont leave me alone.  The problem is, she is a really nice girl, but I'm not interested in her at all.  We have many mutual friends so it's not like I can just disappear entirely.  I am constantly bombarded via texts, facebook messages, invites to do this, invites to do that, and I have finally decided enough is enough. I am worried she is going to do something stupid, like confess her love for me. Its already getting worse. For our one class, I had told her I wasn't going to buy the book because it was around 180 dollars and the class was only 2 credits.  Later that week we meet up to study and she says she accidentally bought two books and that I could have the second. How do I let her know I have no romantic interest in her without actually saying anything of the like.

TITLE: My [50f]mother went on a tirade against a [20f]close friend/roommate accusing her of neglecting and abandoning her cat . And refuses to acknowledge how rudely she went about it.
POST: So a close friend of mine we will call K used to live a house or two down from my mother. Her family still lives there but she moved out. K also has a 14 year old outdoor/indoor cat. Now this cat loves affection and will generally come to see anybody who wanders by. It also likes begging for food, even though it's well fed at home. 

So this, coupled with k coming from a somewhat dysfunctional family, leads my mother to believe that the cat is being neglected. 

Now, k moved out a few years ago to the city which is 400km away. And is now rooming with me. 

She left the cat there. Half because it's a family cat, and half because most apartments she's lived in don't allow pets. 

Now, recently. The cat has become sick and somehow K's family didn't notice. Be it because they thought the symptoms were because of age or being an outdoor cat, Or maybe it's just that K's family is actually being stupid/neglectful and not letting K know her cat was sick. 

Now, my mother. Being a cat owner and being generally vigilant. Noticed this cat was very very sick. 

And messaged me to let K know her cat was sick. Immediately after which she started calling the bylaw officer and asking online for the number to the pound. (It's a no kill pound) 

And when K messaged her to ask her to stop and not call the pound so that she could figure out what to do, my mother accused her of neglecting and abandoning this poor cat. When K was not even aware of it being sick.

K then immediately got a hold of her family and set up an appointment at the vet. 

Now. I don't disagree with my mothers intentions. The cat clearly needed help. But there was a better, more diplomatic method of achieving that than calling the pound when the cats owner lives with her son.  

And it pisses me off that she refuses to acknowledge how rude and insensitive she was in doing this.

We rebuilt the relationship nearly immediately, and all was well, but they kept planting seeds of doubt. They told her I hadn't changed (though she wouldn't tell them that I had gotten medication and treatment), and that this wouldn't last. 

She is from a very controlling family, who have been doing this to her for her entire life. They control every aspect of it, including what clubs she participates in, where she applies for research, whether or not she's doing enough in school etc. She is too afraid to challenge them, and so she didn't.

This last December we were great. Then we went on a month long winter holiday. Every chance she got to text me (she can't text me around her parents) she told me things would be fine when she got back. She shared date ideas, some sexual hints, and assured me we'd pick things up again just as they were.

She got back today. Through tears and final kisses, she broke up with me. She said she had hope, but lost it. And then she left. There are many painful details about our last hour together that hurt too much to even type. But it happened, and I'm in shock.

This was early last week and since then she has been extremely distant. We went for a walk outside and she would talk to me, but not much. She told me today that she does not feel like cuddling or anything like that. I have told her I would hope she would be honest if she knew if this a deal breaker in the relationship and she said ""why wouldnt I?"" so I dropped it. 

I also moved across the country from my place of origin to be with her (we live together) and I dont know if she really wants to be in this anymore and may be afraid of what I would have to go through to get my life back together. She has NEVER been like this in the relationship. We have had arguments and we have maybe gone a day without talking, but nothing this long and this extreme. I am not worried about her seeing or talking to anyone else, she is extremely loyal and honest.

TITLE: Me [30/m] with my fiancee [30/F] says I disrespected her, shutting down
POST: Hey Guys. Short story here. 

Been together for almost 4 years now. And last week I said something she took as disrespectful. I told her ""you dont listen to me"" out of anger and she took it as I was trying to control her and she told me she felt disrespected. This was early last week and since then she has been extremely distant. We went for a walk outside and she would talk to me, but not much. She told me today that she does not feel like cuddling or anything like that. I have told her I would hope she would be honest if she knew if this a deal breaker in the relationship and she said ""why wouldnt I?"" so I dropped it. 

I also moved across the country from my place of origin to be with her (we live together) and I dont know if she really wants to be in this anymore and may be afraid of what I would have to go through to get my life back together. She has NEVER been like this in the relationship. We have had arguments and we have maybe gone a day without talking, but nothing this long and this extreme. I am not worried about her seeing or talking to anyone else, she is extremely loyal and honest. I do want this relationship to work and will do whatever I have to in order to move past this, but I dont know if she is willing to make the same sacrifice.

TITLE: Long term ""girlfriend"" [19] mad at me [19] for sexting with other girl.
POST: I'll give you some context first; I'll try to do so as compacted as possible.

After I broke up with my previous girlfriend, I stayed friends with her older sister. This grew into a de facto relationship. However, she never wanted to upgrade it to an official ""girlfriend-boyfriend"" relationship, because she didn't want to hurt her little sister- (and my ex)'s feelings.

This has been going on for a couple of months, and we are in love with eachother. However, her saying she doesn't want to make what we have into an ""official"" relationship means to me that she doesn't want to make it mutually exclusive.

So it happened that a few days ago I started to flirtateously sending facebook messages to a long term FWB, very very explicit messages at that. Now my ""girlfriend"" has read these, and she's super angry and claims to not even want to remain friends anymore.

Am I unreasonable for interpreting what she has been saying as a rejection of a mutually exclusive relationship? Am I in the wrong for pursuing other women? I understand her anger, as I would also find it devestating if she fucked any other men. But then why would she say she doesn't want a relationship? 

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

POST: First post :), some background information: For some messed up reason, my nipples are extremely hairy, and they are actually the only chest hairs I have. ""Oh my nipples are hairy too"", no. I'm talking about a solid 20 black hairs on each nipple, some of which around 2-3 inches long. 

So right now I'm doing my exams, and I decided, Hey lets procrastinate. I look around the room, oh look tweezers, maybe it's time to do the nips eh? So I start plucking way, ouch. My nipples start turning red. At this point, I've never seen my bare nipple in like 4 years, so this looks pretty weird to me. As I'm plucking them out, I leave them on coffee table to the right of the sofa. After pulling out around 37 hairs, I decide its time for a nap, then I'll study. I forgot about the nipple hair left on the table.

My mum comes home, and after about an hour of so starts shouting at me ""Who's hair is this?!"". Shit. I forgot about them. At this point, she's shouting at me, and I pretty much have to confess that I was just watching TV on the sofa, pulling out my nip hair. She gives me an earful of how disgusting that is (its just hair yeah..), and I end up scooping them into my hands and walking towards the bin. I look at my hand, the hairs are gone.

My nipple hairs are scattered over the floor, and I have no idea where they are. Oh well.

After two months of no contact, we saw each other at a bar and began talking again. A few months later, he asked if I was interested in getting back together.

I am interested, but also suspicious. I'm not sure if I fully understand the situation, and he's a terrible communicator so it's been hard to gauge what his intentions are. I'm not sure if he really misses me and wants to try again or if I'm just a convenient option.

I'm willing to give it another try, but only if we want the same things this time. I would much rather date and take things *very* slow so I can make sure that he's serious about this before committing, but I'm not sure if that's a crazy thing to ask. I want to go back to square one and make sure that he's emotionally invested first so I don't get hurt again.

For me, this would also mean not sleeping together unless we are committed. I don't think this would go over well, but again, I'm just not confident that he sees a future here. Sex was such a huge part of our relationship last time, and we slept together on our first date. There was no waiting, and I was never nervous about him using me for sex but since he broke up with me, the thought has cropped up. I wouldn't expect him to be monogamous until we were actually together. If he only wants to get back together because I'm comfortable and easy, I'm not interested. 

If a relationship developed organically from us dating again, I feel I could let go of the baggage of being dumped the first time around. If not, I avoid getting used. I'd feel better about the situation and not so insecure in my relationship. On the other hand, I feel like I'm playing games by withholding sex and commitment until he ""proves"" that he's serious. I feel like I'm being immature. Thoughts?
TL;DR: "," What are your intentions in wanting to get back together with your ex? 
2. How can you ensure that you are both on the same page emotionally before committing to the relationship? 
3. How do you feel about holding off on sex and other forms of physical intimacy until you both feel confident in the future of the relationship?"

POST: My friend resigned from his job, and his former employer is withholding his last paycheck. He has filed a complaint with the department of labor for the state where he lives, but they said that could take up to 90 days to process and he needs the money now. 

He has tried e-mailing and calling his former employer, but all he got was an extremely nasty, unprofessional, hurtful email in reply saying that the quality of my friends work was not good enough and that he should not be paid, along with baseless allegations of theft.

TITLE: How would you handle a man who has lied about his age? (F/29, M/??)
POST: Back story: I literally just started seeing this man, we've spent time together twice. He is handsome, and quite charming, but something seemed off. This weird suspicion just wouldn't leave me alone.

He is easy to locate on the internet, and some of his family history is easily fact checked via google, (Which I did openly and shamelessly, as I met this guy cold, outside of my social circle, with no one I trust to vouch for him.) and I'm a good listener, so I remember what he tells me about his past.

He is who he says he is, and all that, and his father is fairly high profile, including date of death. Now... here is where it gets tricky. He told me he was in his thirties, which is fine. However, for his father to really be his father, he'd have to be at least in his mid-forties, and that would mean he was born *right* as his father died. Meaning this guy is in his fifties, at least.

I'm in my late twenties.

I feel like I'm being played the fool. That this guy figures that the dumb 20-something won't put together that he is lying.

I'd rather not burn the bridge, even if to just maintain a professional contact. Normally age isn't a big deal to lie about, trimming off a year or two. But to start off getting to know someone with a two decade sized falsehood, I just don't even know.

If you were in my shoes, how would you handle this? What would you say? How would you say it? I don't want to come off like some wackadoo accusing him of lying right as we meet, but the math of his existence simply doesn't add up. Either his father isn't really his father, or he is 20-something years older than he says.

Thanks for reading, sorry if it got rant-y. I'm sad because I really thought he was nice.

POST: *Should this go in /r/relationships? I'm new, go easy on me.*

So my boyfriend and I had a fight earlier, he left at 12:30 PM and we didn't speak until around 7 PM. He did not seem upset or sad, so I thought to ask if he wanted to see me like we planned. This is where he started to ignore me, upon which I got this really bad abstinence and have cried for like an hour because I feel so lonely and ignored by the only person who really cares about me. This is when I realized, instead of crying and texting him, getting my calls blocked etc begging for his attention, I should do something better. First I thought of texting his brother hinting to him we're breaking up (been considering it, just not entirely sure. He does care about me but it's just not working out lately) but then I figured I could do better and use some real trolling advice. Give me your best shot. 

No, I'm not a bitch, or your generic attention whore. I don't intend to be mean, I just think he's purposedly breaking my heart because he knows I really need him when I'm in this mood. I just want to make him talk to me in a fashionably trolling way.

I hadn't given the topic much though afterwards. It dawned on me today though that and this is gunna be simplified if she wants me to dress like a woman, and have sex with me  like a woman (I mean this as in penetrative sex where I am being submissive and penetrated, the whole pegging part).

TITLE: I [26F] do not want to go to my cousins [17F] baby shower
POST: Sometimes I'm very embarrassed of my family. My mother abandoned us a children multiple times for different men after having us when she was 17. My aunt followed a similar path, and my cousin began acting out when she was a preteen. I'd see her chatting on Facebook to adult men, and my aunt did nothing. She started smoking at 15, and my aunt did nothing. She dropped out of high school and ran away, then my aunt did nothing. In fact, when she ran away the last time, my aunt called my mother wailing about how ""everyone abandons her"", and I was disgusted my aunt made this about her.

When my cousin was young, she always said she wanted to be just like me, since I was the only person in my family to attend college and the only female not to have a baby outside of marriage or before age 18. Now, I'm pretty sure she has some type of narcisstic personality disorder. She recently announced she is pregnant with her boyfriend who has never held a job and is an overall gross person (he poops in buckets because he's too lazy to go to the bathroom sometimes) and my family is EXCITED about it. My heart is broken, she had so much potential and now is making the same mistakes as the rest of the family. I feel like my family thinks this is okay, because literally every other female in my family has done this same exact thing, and they've left behind them a string of broken relationships, abandoned children, and criminal behavior.

Long story short, I do not feel like I should pretend to be happy about something like this, when I'm almost positive my cousin did this on purpose, and my aunt allowed this to happen by letting the boyfriend move in when my cousin was 15/16. I love my family, but am I wrong for refusing to congratulate my cousin or attend baby showers?

When my cousin was young, she always said she wanted to be just like me, since I was the only person in my family to attend college and the only female not to have a baby outside of marriage or before age 18. Now, I'm pretty sure she has some type of narcisstic personality disorder. She recently announced she is pregnant with her boyfriend who has never held a job and is an overall gross person (he poops in buckets because he's too lazy to go to the bathroom sometimes) and my family is EXCITED about it. My heart is broken, she had so much potential and now is making the same mistakes as the rest of the family. I feel like my family thinks this is okay, because literally every other female in my family has done this same exact thing, and they've left behind them a string of broken relationships, abandoned children, and criminal behavior.

Long story short, I do not feel like I should pretend to be happy about something like this, when I'm almost positive my cousin did this on purpose, and my aunt allowed this to happen by letting the boyfriend move in when my cousin was 15/16. I love my family, but am I wrong for refusing to congratulate my cousin or attend baby showers?

I started asking him what`s wrond and ofc he said everything`s alright. But it wasn`t, A month after we talked about his behavior i found out that he was chatting with a girl from his school (we learn in different schools). I yelled at him and he said he will stop. 
    On the 14 February he invited me to his place. On the next day he went to school and i was still in his house and i checked his Skype and he was still chatting with her. It was obvious that he liked her. I started behaving really cold. A week after that i told him i read everything. He started apologizing and telling me that he loves me. I didn`t believe, but i didn`t brake up with him.
     A month ago he started behaving like this again, but we talked and he started calling me and we started going out more often. But im still not sure if he loves me, even when he says he does. He even wanted to break up with me because i always say he doesnt love me.
     We`re still together but I can`t trust him and i don`t beleive that he loves me. Always when he is with a girl i think that the same thing will happen. I never wanted to be like one of these girls who freak out about their bf, but i became one of them.

Her boyfriend has gone so far to almost OD and was hospitalized for several weeks for a ""chemical imbalance"", and he claims that he only smokes pot. I feel like he is lying and I don't want my friend Maddie to get involved in hard drugs herself.

She complains all the time to me about how he never text back, and about how he ditches school and stays at home to smoke pot.

TITLE: My boyfriend accidently stepped on the family pet and killed him. Reddit, what's been the most destructive yet honest mistake made by a guest in your home?
POST: Years ago, when I still lived with my family, my boyfriend was over and was making us a big pot of oatmeal. Our little budgie (aka a parakeet) was very personable and always wanted to be on somebody's shoulder. He attempted to climb up my boyfriend's pantleg to get to his shoulder, but my boyfriend didn't see him because he was holding a big pot of water and stepped on him. Unfortunately, it didn't immediately kill him, and he suffered a lot before we were able to get him to the vet's where he finally went. 
Being that he was the only pet we ever had, my sister and I mourned pretty hard as well as our parents. My boyfriend left the house as soon  as I went to sleep that day and felt too guilty to talk to me for the following two weeks. No one (that I know of) was mad at him or spoke of the incident ever again.
This was about 7 years ago. The boyfriend and I broke up later that year for reasons unrelated to this incident, but he still mentions how bad he feels from time to time. We're still friends.

More recently we had the same class and the same lab (<1yr ago). For one experiment we were in the same group and that's where I saw a chance say hi, talk, and eventually get her number.

We have been talking back and fourth since then (as friends). More recently I asked her to have lunch we me over winter break, the text was a little bit more assertive then I have been in others. I think she got the gist in which she mentioned she had move in recently with her fiance and time wouldn't allow for us meeting over break but we could chat in school (we both are still attending).

I replied with a text agreeing that meeting up at school would work out the best, congratulated her on the engagement and apologized if any of my previous text had been inappropriate. She responded that none of them had been and they were ""sweet and thoughtful"".

I guess some of the feelings I have may be disappointment with myself, maybe had I said something back then things could have been different. However I would like to maintain the friendship, I have enjoyed the conversations we've had so far.
TL;DR: "," In hindsight, what do you think could have been done differently to pursue a relationship with this woman prior to her engagement?"

TITLE: My grandmother was just conned out of thousands of dollars by someone posing as her grandson's lawyer.  Is there anything we can do to track this guy down and get the money back?
POST: Long story long, apparently this guy called my grandmother today and told her he was her grandson's lawyer and that her grandson wrecked a rental car in NY, is in the hospital, and needs money to get medical help.  He told her to transfer something around 2 to 3 thousand dollars to someone via Western Union.  She did.  He then called again some time later and said that her grandson needed more money due to legal fees and to transfer the money, again somewhere around 2 to 3 thousand dollars, by the same means only to a different name.  She, again, did what he asked.  Sometime later this evening she finally calls my mother and tells her what had happened and if her grandson was ok.  Of course, everything was ok, and her grandson wasn't even anywhere near NY.  They call the police and tell them about everything that happened, and the police essentially said there's nothing they can do since it was an anonymous cash transfer.  Needless to say, I'm pissed.  I know there are people out there capable of doing heartless shit like this, but it's still hard to believe these guys can actually live with themselves.  I'm also pissed because it seems like the police have just shrugged their shoulders and said we give up.  Does anyone here know if there's anything we can do to try and catch this guy?

TITLE: Employer denying my sick leave before fiscal year  end
POST: I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.  

I work for a large, publicly traded company.  Our fiscal year end is 6/30/11.  As a California employee, my company gives us PTO and sick leave.  They are separate and sick leave does not carry over.  (Employees in other states only receive PTO, but the total # of hours are the same as my PTO + sick leave)  I took some sick leave this week, and noticed that it appears to be taken out of my sick leave for FY2012.  I had time remaining for FY2011 that I was trying to finish using up.  

I emailed HR and a ""payroll specialist"" emailed me back informing me that the last day to report PTO for FY2011 was 6/26 because the week of 6/27 is the beginning of another payroll period and signifies the first payroll period for FY2012.  The ""payroll specialist"" informed me that the sick time I reported earlier this week would be taken from my FY2012 hours.

Is this legal?  I understand how it is convenient for them to make these cutoffs, but am I entitled to the sick leave that i didnt take until this week?
TL;DR: "," Is my employer legally allowed to deny me the use of my sick leave before the end of the fiscal year? 
2. Do other states have similar regulations regarding the use of sick leave during a fiscal year?

TITLE: [Pennsylvania] Requested copy of lease, leasing company has no record of me living in house
POST: I live with three other people. I signed a myriad of paperwork, name changes/addendum, etc. to move in this past summer. The lease was for a year. After a few months of living and attempting compromise, I have come to realize I cannot live in this house anymore. Roommates have pets in the house (they are supposed to pay a fee, but lied to the leasing agency and kept them anyway) that urinate all over the place and refuse to clean it up, among other ""petty"", gross habits they have. Not only is the house a disgusting hole to live in, I am surprised if it is even up to code (bathrooms have no working ventilation systems, no windows), mold in bathrooms, etc.

I contacted the rental agency so I could get a copy of my lease to read over it and see if there was anyway I could get out of it. It was at this point that they let me know that they have absolutely no record of me living in the house, aside from a credit check they ran on me. Furthermore, they said that they never even received a lease renewal form for anyone else for this year. My roommate claims to have handed in the paperwork over the summer and this is the first time I am hearing anything of this.

My question is: what can I do in this situation? Apparently, I am not on the lease. I have no clue where the paperwork I signed to put my name on the lease or my copy of the lease is. My roommate said she turned it in (and they ran the credit check, so they must have had something), but the leasing agency still has the previous tenants on the lease. Can I use this to my advantage and move out after I find another place? If I did this, could someone come back to me asking for money? I just want to find out what my options are.
TL;DR: "," What legal options do I have for terminating my lease, given that the leasing agency has no record of my living in the house?

TITLE: Dear Reddit What is your best ""ran out of gas in my car"" story?
POST: My story: My car was about to hit 100,000 miles and I along with my two passengers (my brother and a girl) were too excited to notice that we had almost no gas left. Then we hit about 8 straight miles of solid traffic, barely move for 45 minutes. Odometer hits 100,000 miles and everybody is excited. 

Suddenly, the car turns off. I turn the key, it starts up goes a few feet, then turns off. Panic begins to set in. I've just run out of gas for the first time. It's pretty dark and the temperature is about 40°F. Nearest gas station is about 4 miles away. I have T-mobile which means no service, my brothers phone has no charge left, and the girl doesn't have a phone.

I tell them to wait here and lock the doors, I would go to the gas station and grab some gas. I start walking to the gas station and
about a mile in I'm freezing, cant feel my hands, face or legs. Suddenly, a car pulls up next to me with about four people in it and they ask if I need any help. I ask if they could give me a ride to the gas station nearby and they say sure. 

Turns out that while the driver was somewhat sober  the rest were piss drunk, and all had open containers of beer. Just as we pull in to the gas station the girl in the back just drops to the floor of the car spilling beer everywhere. Driver looks back and just says: ""fuckin Jules."" What I didn't notice was that the Jules had spilled beer all down the front of my pants in a perfect pissed pants pattern. The few minuted I had spent in the car did little to relieve the lack of feeling in my legs and I didn't even feel the beer hitting my legs. 

I proceed to calmly exit the vehicle and thank them for the ride and thank Jules for her company. At which point I entered a fairly busy gas station, waited a few minutes in line and purchased a gallon of gas. All with a massive piss pattern on my pants. 

Then I walked back 4 miles to my car in the cold.

POST: My partner and I have been together for a few months now. We're still going through the getting-to-know-you phase, and so far things are going pretty well. 

He and I both have children from previous relationships, which means we both have to keep contact with our exes. The issue I'm having is that he seems to be very involved with his child's mother, as well as other exes he has. I'm not really concerned that he's doing something wrong, but it seems a little off. Last night he stayed up texting his ex because apparently she and her fiance had broken up. That really really bothered me, and I'm not sure if it was okay. I have an ex and we're friendly, but I don't feel like it would be appropriate to sit on the phone with him for a few hours. It almost feels disrespectful?..I'm not really a jealous person, but it made me feel awkward, especially because we were hanging out last night and he was on the phone the entire time, so I just went to bed. 

I'm really uncertain about bringing this up. Should I? I know it's his ex and his child's mother, and it's been so long since they were together that they've worked through most of the anger towards one another, but I feel like he would be really upset if I had done that with my ex. How should I bring it up? Is this even a reasonable concern or should I just let it go? I think one of my main concerns is that she's reaching out to him in a way that seems inappropriate to me, and with him making himself available to her in that way makes me feel uneasy.

I can say, though, that my personality kicks all of their asses, so I've got that going for me. Haha :-/

I've never felt insecure in any of my relationships until now and it's driving me crazy. I haven't actually mentioned my insecurities to my boyfriend because I know how it will come across and I know that sort of thing can be super unattractive. I guess I'm just wondering if there is any way I can get over this or am I just doomed with these terrible thoughts forever? Does anybody have any tips n' tricks for me?

TITLE: reddit, how do I deal with my insane, elderly coworker?
POST: So, she sits five feet from me.  

I was moved into a shared space with her about a week ago.  I knew from the get-go it was going to be hard... she is a complainer, hard for everyone on staff to deal with, and the like.  We have a very close-knit group otherwise.  

She likes to:  

-talk to herself out loud, approximately an hour a day combined  
-she clears her throat THREE TIMES A MINUTE.  ALL DAY.  ALL.  DAY.  
-she incessantly stops me to tell me about her lunch.  In detail.  Using phrases like 'just a really nice sandwich'.  I want to be editing video and doing social, not pretending to care.  

Before I paint the picture that I'm a monster, I am not.  This is NOT a kindly old woman.  This is the bingo hall type.  She recently was bragging about how she was going to make a man cheat on his wife.  She complains about everything (irony, I know, relax), and she, to customers and vendors, loves to talk about how everyone here 'treats her like a piece of shit and fuck them.'  Legitimately just not a good person.  

Yesterday, I was concentrating incredibly hard on a project, so I wasn't focusing all of my energy on not yelling at her.  She interrupted my for the fourth or fifth time saying it was 'unacceptable' to have my computer on the floor beside my desk.  I almost just told her to fuck herself.  So close.  I can't do that.

  
I know I sound like an entitled brat- but I have normal, although occasionally conflicting relationships with everyone here.  We all work through it like normal coworkers.  This woman is the anomaly.  I want to stop coming to work.  

Please reddit, tips.  Please.

POST: Some background information, I'[m] 21 and she is 22. We have been dating for a bit over a year now and about a month ago we started an LDR (both got different jobs out of college, she left I had to stay) where we will not be able to see each other until Jan. She has been my only partner, where as she has had 6 others, I know this number is not allot but to me it is still quite a few.  
  
I love her very much and whenever I'm around her I want to spend my as much time as I can with her. But whenever we are apart I cant get over that I am number 7. I know that there are times when she looks back fondly on sex with other people and that hurts, I know this may be immature but it is how I feel, I've spent a long time trying to get over it and she is fairly dismissive (it's the past, I cant change it, get over it) the one or two times I briefly brought it up. Even some times when we are together or intament it briefly hits me, I am not special she has had this before I'm just the next / last in a line. I also know a few of her ex-partners and have a very vivid and sometimes uncontrolled imagination, this also is not fun a contribution to the issues.
  
This feeling really hurts allot, and I'm worried our relationship cannot survive my insecurity's with such a distance between us. The problem is I don't see myself with anyone else she is almost perfect, but I don't wanna wind up resenting her. There are times when I almost wanna take a break, sleep with a few other people just so I get the fuck over it. But I also know it would have to be a one sided thing, I couldn't get back with her if I knew there was someone else, again immature but this is just how I feel, and it would not be fair or even feel alright for me to make it unidirectional.

POST: I recently turned 24, and it's just starting to hit me that this is the end of my younger years. 25 seems like such a big jump. It's like the ""official"" start of adulthood.

 I feel like I'm nowhere near as far along as I thought I would be when I was younger. Even though I live on my own in a new city with my gf (who is 2.5 years younger than me), have 2 jobs (both part time, but im working on getting full time at one of them), I just feel like I should've been doing this years ago. I dont have a career, I'm not ready for marriage, I don't have a car, etc etc. 

I feel like I cant see my future. Time is moving by faster than it ever has, and I feel like there's nothing I can do to stop it / change anything. 

I feel so alone. My one job is at an office so there I only work with older people, and my other job is retail so there I only work younger people. Its either my co workers can't relate to me, or I can't relate to my coworkers. It feels like going through puberty all over again. Literally, where are all the mid 20 year olds??

To my fellow 24/25 year olds, do you find yourself feeling the same as me??

She recently moved into a new apartment and I basically live with her since I spend every night and the majority of my days there.
I am a very quiet guy and tend to take great care in keeping the noise I create to a minimum. This isn't just because I'm a quiet person but a habit out of my upbringing. I was always told to chew with your mouth closed, don't scrape the fork with your teeth, don't slurp, pick up your feet and don't stomp when you walk etc. My biggest pet peeve is people who chew loudly/ chew with their mouth open. I've tried trying to ignore when people do this but it just drives me insane.
My girlfriend was very similar to me in her old apartment. Quiet, well mannered, and very polite. Since moving into the new place she has developed several habits that irritate me to the point of wanting to end our relationship. She has started chewing with her mouth open, scraping her teeth on forks, drinking excessively loud especially when she swallows among a few other things. I've pointed this out because their the biggest issues for me.

I've attempted to bring this up to her in a way that I figured that I wouldn't come off as rude but it just ends up with her getting mad at her saying I'm 'too critical of her.' She's correct to a degree but these habits never used to exist at all (I wouldn't have dated her this long if they were) and I feel like I'm not being too needy wanting her to try and correct this bad habits.

POST: I have known this guy, Thomas, for about a year.  He is the same major as me and several of my close friend group, and was introduced to us by another friend in an academic setting (working on homework together, etc).  Since then, we've invited him to a lot of our gatherings and parties, but he hasn't really ""clicked"" socially or made friends with any of the members of our social circle.  Thomas has always been socially awkward, but he's nice, polite, and shares a lot of interests with us.

The issue at this point is that, at a party yesterday, Thomas was drunk and said some things that made some people, including my girlfriend, uncomfortable.  He was making strange, non-sequitur comments and sometimes not making sense, as well as talking to people about his sexuality, which was not appropriate conversation for the setting.  Additionally, he now has my phone number for the first time.  This has led to him reaching out to me and my roommate to spend time with him, which we would rather not do.  He's a nice enough guy, but we're still uneasy over the way he was acting at the party.  Some of his texts have been pushy, stating that he's being intentionally excluded or implying that I need to inform him the next time I plan something.

It may seem like a dick move, but I really just don't want to spend time with Thomas.  I don't think he has many other friends, but I don't think that makes me obligated to help him join our social circle.  What can I do to distance myself without hurting his feelings too much?  Also, he has texted my roommate, but with less frequency.  He feels the same way about the situation, and I'm worried Thomas will turn to him if I reject him.

What do you think, Reddit?  Am I being too harsh?  My time is pretty valuable at this point in my life, and I have lots of other ways I would rather spend it.
TL;DR: "," What strategies can I use to gently distance myself from Thomas without hurting his feelings? 
2. How can I politely explain to Thomas that I don't want to hang out with him without coming off as rude or insensitive?  
3. Is it selfish of me not to try and help Thomas join my social circle, even though I know he doesn't have many other friends?"

POST: I met this girl from Tinder a few days ago and we decided to meet up. We're both of the same background (Hindu), however she is much more successful than I am. She already has her stuff together whereas I'm still a 3rd year medical student. She's already done with her residency. 

I feel bad about the one night stand, because I lied to her about what I do. I told her that I'm already a 4th year resident so I could have a chance with this girl. I lied because most of the Indian girls I meet on Tinder immediately get turned off when I tell them I'm still a student. 

For being 28 and not having your sh!t together for an Indian, is pretty bad. Yes, yes, I know that I'm working towards something, and I shouldn't let it bother me - but it does. I'm honest about it when I meet girls of other races, because they don't care. However with brown girls, it's really unfortunate that I have to lie to get laid.

POST: I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this post. Let me know and I can repost somewhere else.

I'm a male, 22 years of age in grad school. This past summer while I was at an internship 6 hours away, my gf of 2.5 years broke up with me. That was 4.5 months ago. I don't feel I'm over her one bit and while at school we are 150 miles apart. An obvious problem is that we still follow eachother on social media outlets....I know I need to stop that.

We spent all but 8 months of our relationship in a long-distance one. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, I'm sad and am missing the past. The future doesn't look hopeful, but I know it will go on. This sucks because by all other aspects I know I have my future made, career and financially-wise. I've never done this before, really, so some help on if this is normal would be great. It's hard to take male-friends advice cause most say I should just hook up with a girl when I don't want to and I don't have any close female friends. 

Mainly all I can do is think of how we both could have done things different. Talk about a horrible thing to do. Painful!

TITLE: I'm on medication that completely kills my appetite. Should I be worried? M/25/6'4""/372-~325
POST: I am currently down about 45-50 pounds through diet and exercise in about 4-5 months. I cut out most carbs and processed foods (keto-ish. HFLC I guess is more accurate, 20-50g carbs daily), and I now walk about 3-5 miles a day as well as doing some light strength training 2-3 days a week. 

So far I'm happy with my progress, but I recently got back on Adderall XR for my ADHD and it makes me want to not eat....ever. I can tell when I'm hungry but I just have no desire to actually consume food. I do force myself to eat daily, but I think most days I eat 1200 calories or less. 

I started at 372ish and am now in the 320's, so it's still working, but is it okay to eat so little? I don't know the exact numbers, but I think even for weight loss, I could technically eat 2000 or even more a day if I stay active. It literally makes me sick to eat any more than I already do, though
.
I guess the real question is, given the amount of excess weight I have, is it okay for me to create deficits of this size, or should I try to find some way to boost my caloric intake?

I mentioned this to my psychiatrist when adjusting my medication and she basically said, try your best to eat more, but it's not of any real concern until you start wasting away and we don't need to worry about that anytime soon. I really need to be on the medication to function the way I'd like to, so stopping it isn't a viable option at the moment for me.
TL;DR: "," Is it safe to maintain such a large deficit in caloric intake while taking Adderall XR for ADHD? 
2. What alternatives are available to help me increase my appetite while taking medication? 
3. What are the potential risks of continuing to eat such a small amount of calories while taking Adderall XR?"

TITLE: Me [28 M/F] with my girlfriend [30 M/F] of almost 2 years, dealing with a communication barrier and a rising jealous obsession.
POST: It took me a long time to commit to my girlfriend, and during that time where we were somewhat more casual, I had plenty of interest from others and I used to talk to plenty of women, I didn't hook up with anyone but I liked to know that others are interested and that I have options, but as our bond became stronger and I fully committed to her, I completely stopped giving anyone else my attention, even my close friendships with females took a hit as I gradually prioritized my relationship.

Problem is, she still hasn't done that. I always felt that she is more receptive to approaches that I'd like her to be, and after a couple of failed attempts to communicate that to her, my obsession got the best of me and I looked through her text messages. I found details that made my stomach turn, such as her giving other guys her number, indicating interest and having a flirty conversation then shutting it down. Another was when she told me she met an ex by-chance and talked to him briefly then stopped. I found the conversations on her phone.. The flirtation was strong, familiar, and reciprocated. While it didn't go anywhere, I feels like it could in the future and I still feel betrayed. I know she is committed to me and would not stray (she has had chances and not taken them), but her behavior is making me feel inadequate and affecting my trust of her.  

I know going through other people's private stuff is a lowly move, and I regret doing it. However, my intuition is usually spot on, and whenever I feel like there's something going on and do a bit of spying, I find enough information to confirm it.  What should I do ?

POST: So today we picked up a cat from my father-in-law. They got her from the pound but the child who wanted her wasn't taking care of her. We have a mice problem and decided to take her off their hands. She is a super sweet cat. Cuddly and very calm. My father-in-law has a very old dog so the cat is accustomed to dogs.

Our dog is almost 2 years old. She has been around other cats and never had any issues with them, would hardly even notice they were there. When we brought our cat home she immediately ran behind our couch (which we expected) so we set her up a little base. Litter box, water and food dish are within a foot of the couch openings. Whenever the cat does decide to venture out her and my dog have at it the second my dog sees her.

POST: My daughter has always been quiet.  She's never had more than one or two friends at a time, and the friendships never really lasted.  From what I know it's not because they have fall-outs or anything, but because the other girls get bored of her.  My daughter's the type that speaks when spoken to, she's been like this ever since she was little.

She's never liked playing with other kids, or playing in general.  As a kid she used to sneak away from recess to read inside.  I'm bookish too so I never really saw that as an issue.  

I recently heard from her high school gym teacher, who is also a family friend, that she's really struggling in gym class.  My daughter isn't a thin girl, but she's not particularly overweight either.  We eat healthy at home, but there's no culture of exercise.
Her older sister is rail thin and honestly doesn't have the time to exercise (between school and theater commitments she sleeps maybe 5-6 hours a night), I'm obese but am losing weight (I currently go on walks every night but my daughter won't join me), and my husband (married 20 years) plays sports every now and then (daughter abhors team activities, always has).

Recently we just went for a walk around the city and my daughter got out of breath rather quickly.  Even though I'm much heavier than her, I wasn't tired at all, so I was rather concerned.

POST: Hello Reddit. I'm a 17 years old guy, and I've been seriously considering what I want to do for the rest of my life...

I always, as a child, thought of being something like a physicist, or a civil engineer. But hell... I can't imagine myself working for the rest of my life behind a desk. I don't mind having to study for my career, as I'm a pretty smart guy (I'm great with numbers). 

I was thinking on becoming a pilot, and it's a plan, but I want to have more options to pick from.

Anyways, I love human anatomy and calculations/numbers, those are my best traits academically. 
I want a job that, even if gives a low pay... I just want to have an active job, where I have to interact with other people alot, can meet new people. Being able to travel would be a major plus. I just don't want to get stressed out, work too much and see my stomach grow with time.

POST: To fully understand the story you must know that i am bound to an electric wheelchair. 

It was a normal day at school, nothing out of the ordinary. Until a teacher came into the class room and told us that we could leave early today (10 am). Now i had a problem because this happened before i got my drivers license. And the way i normally transported myself back and forth was with a taxi.
Normally the taxi wouldn't show up till 2.30 pm, so i tried to get the taxi to show up sooner so i didn't have to wait, but i was told that wasn't possible.

And this is where everything went wrong. I went into rage mode, and told myself that just because the teachers couldn't plan their schedule in advance i shouldn't be stuck at school. So i had the brilliant idea of driving all the way home by myself. In my wheelchair. Out on the road. First of all it was pretty scary driving on a road where people were only inches away from hitting me multiple times, but the worst thing happened when i was half-way home. The chair gave out... I remembered, stupid as i was, that i had forgotten to charge the battery on my chair. I just made it past the road sign and was stranded at the sidewalk. So i sat there for an hour, normally that wouldn't be a problem but i also forgot to mention that i didn't bring any warm clothes and it was in the middle of the winter. And to top it all of when sitting there in misery, hating myself for being stupid, one of my friends drove past me in his car waving and smiling like an idiot, because he couldn't see that i was stranded and he just drove on. But my luck finally changed for just a short period of time. I managed to convince someone to come pick me up and drive me home. 

Now it would probably seem like this was all over, but because life happened to wanna teach me a lesson i also had to be sick for a week

POST: I'm 24 right now and paying about $200 a month into a pension (CPP). I got a decent job after college so they offered me one and I took it. 

Unfortunately I have about $25,000 in student loans (OSAP) and about $6,000 in a Line of Credit. My OSAP is set to be paid off in ten years, but that's a long time and my payments are about $320 a month.

I will be likely moving to a different town and working for a different company. This makes me think it would be next to impossible to try to keep a pension going. I much rather start worry about it once my loans are paid off. 

Money can be tight sometimes, I'm living with my girlfriend and these loan payments suck a lot. I want them gone as quickly as possible so I can use the free money to save and invest it.

        I've been dating my current girlfriend for 11 months. About 4 months into the relationship she cheated on me during a ""girls night out."" She seemed very apologetic, and I really liked this girl throughout high school so I wanted to make it work. Months go by and I still don't trust her, (probably due to my own self esteem). One night I drunk text one of our mutual female acquaintances that she went out with, the night that she cheated. I asked, ""why didn't you stop her, and if she had something against our relationship."" She replied first to my SO while ignoring my texts. When the mutual friend finally did reply she stated,"" I don't like you, respect you, or want you with her"". My girlfriend and I talked about what she said and she told me that ""You don't need to like her, shes my friend not yours"". I don't know if I should end the relationship, but I can't ever trust her with that friend. Her friend always invites guys to ""girls nights out."" Knowing that she willingly has a friend that disrespects me like that often makes me question if the relationship is worth it.

POST: My fiancé and I have been together for just under 2 years. We got engaged last month and plan to marry next summer. We are extremely compatible and he is the person I want to spend my life with. 

I was accepted to my dream school, one the best in the world. He has been extremely supportive of my aspirations from the start, and weve been making plans for it since I started applications last fall. It was an exciting surprise to us both that I got in, and now that I have, I am trying to make plans for us to move. 

We currently live on the west coast and we both absolutely love it. He has a flexible career that allows him to work/travel from basically anywhere. But business school is in the Northeast, and while neither of us want to leave the sunny weather, I assumed we would be compromising on this as we had always discussed. 

Now as we are getting closer to the summer, he is having second thoughts. He wants me to go first and him to go later, but with no timeline in mind. He currently is on a short term project on the west coast and he could very easily find one to relocate him to the northeast. However, he is primarily in tech so Silicon Valley is the ideal area for him to be in, and he cites his network and potential of opportunity for being the reason for delay. 

Neither of us are deeply rooted in our current town of only 1 year. I am sad, hurt, and offended that he has hesitated now to allow me to enjoy this opportunity. I received other acceptances as well that would have let us stay in our current area; we collectively decided that I should pick the school in the northeast. I am worried that if I go without him he will never come, and I don't want to waste my first semester or year being held back or confused about where my future lies. What should I do? How can I deal with this in the right way?

When we got back to my house we just stood there not saying anything until she said she keeps making rush decisions, after some tears, and her explaining her feelings I told her that if she needed to breakup with me for school or to be happier or anything then she should do it, I'm not everything in the world and she needs to put herself above me. 

I'm just trying to figure my own stuff out, she begged to be friends and for me to not hate her and I don't hate her, I don't know about being friends as it would only cause us to get back together (which isn't best for the both of us) or turn toxic if one of us started seeing somebody else. Anybody have advice other than the simple ""time heals all wounds"" I'm trying to stay occupied but its Friday and all of my friends are working or busy and so I am alone and very depressed at this point, I'm just looking for really good albums, movies or games that give you a good feeling or something to help, any sort of seemingly unorthodox advice is totally welcome and if something helped you focus on new beginnings and a better future please let me know! hell I just want some more human interaction.

POST: I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year, with a few breakups and fights in between. When we first started dating I was his ""dream girl"" and he treated me better than anyone ever has. But as the relationship progressed he grew distant and stopped complimenting me or being affectionate or making time for me, etc. I really want our relationship to go back to how it used to be and when I bring it up to him he says he is the same and that he is doing everything he used to which is obviously not true. I have tried to give him space, I've tried to act like it doesn't bother me, yet nothing I do seems to make him treat me even close to the way he used to. I feel very unwanted, unappreciated, and unimportant to him. He makes me feel like his second choice as a way to spend his time, like something else is always more interesting or important than me. It's taking a huge toll on my happiness and confidence in the relationship. What can I do to change the way he treats me and our relationship?

TITLE: Me [19M] with my ex-girlfriend [18F] went out for 6 months but are now weird almost friends
POST: We went out for a couple of months and had a pretty strong relationship, but we were just not right for each other. We mutually decided to break up, and agreed to give each other time and space before we could become friends again. I did, however, say that I wanted to still be friendly with her and talk through this process, as she has a gorgeous personality and we get along very well, but she has been completely blanking me. I really don't want this happening because I like her as a person and want to be friends with her, but it seems like that we are drifting further apart. 

Every now and then she comes over to mine (we go to the same college and she lives close by) to talk, and we are friendly. However, in public she is more distant and ignores me almost completely. Last night I said that I just wanted her to be happy and if that meant finding a new boyfriend, I would not mind. However, I said it a little awkwardly and so she ended up crying. I think she inferred that I was saying I wanted to move on and find a new girlfriend. This was, however, not my intention. I texted her apologizing, explaining the miscommunication, but she ignored my texts. I also saw her again that same night, and she blanked me completely, not even saying hi or acknowledging my presence.

I know it will take time for us to become friends, but I don't know what to do because it seems like everything I say hurts her in some way and drives us slightly further apart.

TITLE: My boyfriend is really shy, and quiet. So much so, that I feel like I'm making him uncomfortable by bringing things up that need to be talked about...like sex. I need some advice here.
POST: I'm 21/f and he's 27/m, we've been seeing each other for almost 3 months now.

To give you some perspective on the shyness issue, let me tell you a little story first. I had a conversation with him (via facebook...) about being frustrated with our lack of communication, which in ways has improved, but it's still got a ways to go. Later that night, we were discussing our previous conversation and he said something like, ""So, to give you some perspective on who I am..."" Peppered with many Umms and pauses. ""Its hard for me to put into words, but, umm, I've had intimate relations with this many people."" And he held up his hand. I kid you not, it took him what seemed like 5 minutes to spit this out while I patiently listened. Clearly he felt extremely awkward talking about it.

I'm a very sexual person, and I've had a lot of partners...certainly a lot more than I can count on one hand...or two. I'm very confident that I know what I like in the bedroom.

We do have sex pretty regularly, and for the most part it's pretty good, but I REALLY want to talk to him about some things he/we can do to make it better, however I'm afraid that it's going to make him feel really uncomfortable/self conscious, and like I'm putting him on the spot. I feel like a total fucking coward writing him an email or facebook message about things like this, but at this point I kind of feel like it's the best way to get through to him without him feeling too awkward or under pressure to quickly respond/know what to say. Plus it gives him the impression that I would rather communicate that way, which is totally not the case at all...I want to work towards making him feel comfortable talking to me about ANYTHING, which I have told him that he should be, but clearly that wasn't enough.

POST: Hi there!

after lurking around here for a while I thought it was time to make a post, especially after reading some comments that I found helpful

I am 22 years old, I was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome at a young age. 

however, what you would call high functioning, as I am very sociable and have a great group of close friends.

3 months ago I arranged for myself and a 27 year old female friend who I have known for 4 1/2 years, to go looking at stars through high powered telescopes at a community event. 

It's a surprise for her because she adores stars and space, an interest we share. Unfortunately when we arrived it was closed, and we decided to do it later on. 

Fast forward 3 months; we meet up for life drawing and she tells me that she is going stargazing at the same place with her boyfriend. In other words, my idea.

I know for a fact that it was her who suggested it, and not her boyfriend, who is often lazy and forgetful (for instance I was one of the only people who remembered to wish her a happy birthday)

Am I wrong for feeling resentful and cheated? and how can I go about raising the issue with her, without her getting the wrong idea?

Part of me wants to be completely honest and upfront about my feelings.

I have already posted in /r/aspergers, but I thought I would also get the opinions of you fine ladies and gentlemen.

- We go out on a couple of dates and have a really good times
- I start to like him and have a feeling he feels the same way
- Texting/snapping still happens
- We hookup usually around the 3rd or 4th date
- He gets distant, the communication dwindles or if he does want to talk, it's only about sex 
- Everything stops, despite my attempts to get it back on track and I delete them

It's just SO heartbreaking to feel like you have a connection with someone, only to realize they only saw you as a conquest and all of the nice things they said and did were just to get you in bed.

POST: We are both university students (studying different degrees but same campus) and i feel that we aren't spending enough time together. 

We only catch up occasionally during the week for a coffee or lunch, and i will stay at her parents house every few weekends, which i feel is too little. I have told her this, and her standard response is ""i would love to catch up more, but ive been really busy with lab work lately"". Additionally, we barely talk online as she is barely on social media (and therefore takes many hours to respond to my texts and facebook messages).

My girlfriend is a very quiet and withdrawn girl who has almost zero experience with any other relationships. She is also a virgin and isn't ""ready for anything more than making out"". I completely respect her boundaries and wouldn't do anything to make her feel pressured, but im really starting to feel the struggle of having no sexual interaction. A recent serious discussion of this revealed that she has some personal issues to get over first, though she was uncomfortable with sharing with me what they were for whatever reason.

This would seem an obvious issue to resolve except for the fact that her immediate family really like me and think that we are perfect for each other and all is great. Her mum goes out of her way to help me all the time, even with simple things she makes a massive effort to ensure i'm happy.

TITLE: My (22F) boyfriend (22M) has attempted to look at my Facebook without my permission twice now. What do?
POST: So when he is in a bad state of mind he has these jealous, as he calls them, ""trances."" The first time he looked at my Facebook messages on my computer when I left the room to go do something one night when we were first dating (like a month in). He told me about it the next day and we discussed it. I decided to give it another chance because the relationship was awesome in pretty much every other respect, including honesty.

Things went well and now we have been dating for 7 months. He is off visiting his family now but he messaged me this morning saying that he had logged in to my Facebook yesterday because I had taken an exceptionally long time to respond to his last message and he was paranoid. He said he didn't look at anything (frankly I don't care if he did. There's nothing I wouldn't want him seeing, but it bothers me that he decided to look anyway), and just felt bad and logged back out immediately.

However, I got a notification that someone had tried to log into my Facebook that morning (must have been him), but also that evening. He did not mention the second time. That would have been after I had responded to him.

I have talked about this with him and my concerns are that, while I want this to work, I don't want to be a pushover. I understand it can be easy to be a pushover when you are really into the person you are dating (been there enough for sure), but seriously, this is the only problem we've had in our relationship.

TITLE: I am trying to build a program for February using MOSSA videos for Xbox One. Any advice is welcomed!
POST: Hi /r/loseit, I have somehow found myself the sole active moderator over at /r/XboxFitness , and I need some advice in crafting a routine for what has swelled to over 150 people! (When I started it was like 30 people, now that the membership is large... I want to get it right).

The single most requested feature was a ""schedule"" (I had simply been posting my workouts for others to follow or not). So I started planning my weeks videos out...

**What is Xbox Fitness?**

Xbox Fitness is an app on xbox that ""Game-ifies"" various exercise DVDs with the Kinect camera, giving users points for reps, holding their form, etc. etc.

**What the community has done**

In January we started a ""January with Jillian Michaels"" program. We started with ""Ripped in 30"" on MWF and ""Extreme Shed and Shred"" on TuTh(Sa). Some people even added Kickboxing to MWF to get an hour's worth of fitness in. These tapes (ooh, dating myself), are all cross training. That is, they all have some weight training, cardio, and bodyweight fitness, and some abs.

**The Problem with February**

This is where Im seeking advice. The members of /r/XboxFitness have expressed interest in using the MOSSA selections for February. MOSSA divides cardio from weightlifting from abs into 3 separate 30 min routines. The MOSSA selections are

* Core 1 30min

* Core 2 30min

* Fight 1 30min

* Fight 2 30min

* Groove 1 30min

* Power 1 30min

* Power 2 30min

Would there be a significant advantage to dividing the days by type (ie MWF = 2x fight videos for an hour of cardio & TuThSa 2x Power videos for an hour of lifting)? Or for this kind of exercise, would it be better to mix a power and fight video each day? How often would you recommend the 30 min abs? Would it be better to have shorter power or cardio when adding an abs video?

POST: Howdy all!

So, I'm on day two in a row of actually going to the gym (wahoo) although this may seem small, this is the start of me ACTUALLY working out.. or trying to.

My question about cardio is this:

So, when I'm tossin' bows on the fancy treadmill at my gym, it tells me lovely things like heart rate, distance, time, etc. One thing it tells me, of course, is calories burned (which I know is most likely estimated and what not) So, I've kinda set my goal per day as 2.5 miles, which I do at an average of 3.9mph (the fancy machine told me so). My question is, at the end of my workout it tells me I have burned around 155 calories. 

Now this information is disheartening, as you all know, everyone likes to focus on calories. So, should I be sad that I am only burning a measly 155 calories a workout, or is there some secret the fancy machine is keeping from me. (Like the concentration camp party it's throwing for my belly fat) OR.... am I walking 2.5 miles just for those 155 calories :/

Problem:
I missed the ceremony. When I say I missed the ceremony, I mean I was out partying with everyone from the wedding the night before and stayed up too late and got up too early. After breakfast I laid down for a nap and did not wake up until a friend called after the ceremony was over.

I did follow through with the rest of the night. I went to the speeches and the dance and even got some classic ""do you have anything to say to the newly wed's"" clips.

POST: This has left me scratching my head for some time now.  

I'm getting married in August.  I'm a U.S. Citizen and he's from Ireland.  We won't be getting citizenships right away because we plan on travelling and going to grad school first. Neither of us wants to give up our original citizenship obviously, but that would mean going back and forth with just a green card maybe?

My fiance doesn't really care all too much because the job market in the US is shit and he's fine with just a green card.  But we're planning on possibly getting a job somewhere in Europe (Southern France hopefully) and it might affect me if I'm not an Irish citizen like him.  This will mean that I'll be the jobless free-loader wife and that's completely not me.

TITLE: My husband [24M] wants to join a college fraternity, and I [24F] do not know how to react.
POST: A bit about me - I'm a 24 year old female who graduated from community college 4 years ago. I have working since then to raise money to pay for tuition, housing, textbooks, car and some entertainment (PS4, Xbox one, Wii U, TV). I met my husband at the end of high school, right after we broke up with our exes. We married 2 years later, after i finished community college. My husband is 24, and got out of the Marines. We will attend the same college, and the Marines will pay my husband's tuition and housing.  We have no kids. 

One of the counselors in the Marines suggested my husband to join a fraternity in college. He likes the idea of it. He wants to have people to work out with, play video games with, and to study with. He is deciding between a service fraternity and a social fraternity. I am not too easy with this and have a few questions. 

1. If he joins a social fraternity, what are the chances he will cheat on me with a sorority girl? I trust him, but don't trust the people he will be with. Hollywood movies like Animal House and Neighbors 2 don't help either. 

2. If he joins the service fraternity, he will have to hang out with his high school ex (who followed my plan to go to community college and work to pay for tuition and housing). How can he avoid contact with her?

3. How much time will he have to spend time with me, while he joins and pledges a fraternity? He will be working and taking classes, and I don't want this to tear us apart. 

4. He is suggesting me to join a sorority if he joins a social fraternity. What the hell is that? Do sorority chicks cheat on their partners? I don't want to be affiliated with them. How will I 

5. The service fraternity is coed. He is suggesting me to join that with him. But both our exes are in that fraternity. How can we avoid our exes? Since they both are  officers in that fraternity, we will have to interact with them. 

Thanks Reddit!
TL;DR: "," What benefits and responsibilities would come with joining a fraternity?

TITLE: My (23F) LD guy (28M) thinks that some sexual stuff I did were disgusting and said that he isn't sure if he can kiss me.
POST: We have been chatting for 4 months now and I had plans to see him in August. I bought plane ticket. Things were good. I have more sexual experience, which wasn't hard to have because he has almost none. We talked about sex and he mentioned rim job. I said sure, no problem, I can do it. He asked if I did it before, I said yes. He said thing from the title 'It is disgusting, I am not even sure if I can kiss you now.' This was few days ago and he didn't reply on my last message. 

Hour ago, he contacted me again and I don't know what is good response. He was nice and funny. I enjoyed chatting with him (a lot!), but I cooled off and I am not interested in someone who acts like this. Or maybe his reaction wasn't big deal? Maybe it has something to do with lack of sexual experience? I usually pick guys who are open to new experiences and they never commented that something is disgusting.

Maybe little info about me so that you have some perspective. I had 4 sex partners. I guess that craziest what I did are rim jobs (I am not into bdsm, orgies, any kind if fetishes...) I tried that with my last boyfriend. When I mentioned rim job he was like puppy when someone holds  a cookie. So I decided to try it and it was great, very simple and easy. He had big dick (20cm) so blow jobs were hard work for someone lazy like me. He was also very giving in bed and I was happy that I can satisfied him. Seeing him pleased made me very pleased too.

TITLE: Me [22F] with [25M] - Dating for about a month, he suddenly 180s it and ""just wants to be friends""
POST: So, for the past month, I've been seeing ""Drake"" (25m). Things were going great. We met through a mutual friend, and since he got my number, we haven't stopped talking. He's sweet and smart. He's a super busy guy who goes to school, and works, and plays in a band 5 nights a week, but he still made time to see me 3 or 4 times a week. He wasn't pushing for anything too fast (waited until like our 4th date to kiss me) and I was starting to think like, yeah, hey, this is someone I could be with who wouldn't make me want to stab myself in the gut.

About a week ago, after a particularly nice afternoon alone (We both live with our parents right now as he's in school and i just graduated so privacy isn't always a thing) I texted him something along the lines of: ""hey, I just wanted to be honest about something. I don't sleep with anyone I'm not in a relationship with."" I just didn't want him to have any false expectations about where things were heading. He said he understood.

We had plans for Saturday night, and he sent me a quick text asking to call him when I got the chance. We played phone tag for a couple hours before he called me. He told me flat out he just wants to be friends, but he totally still wants to hang out that night and he wants to still be able to check in on me. (I have a recent knee injury that he's been really sweet about helping me tend to). I told him no thanks, I didn't want to go out that night anymore and we hung up.

So basically reddit, what the hell. Did I fuck up by saying the word ""relationship?"" I put off even bringing it up because I was afraid he'd think I wanted to date immediately when I LOVED taking things at a turtle's pace. There were just no warning signs about this whatsoever. I have no idea what's going on.

POST: We are each other's first real relationship and everything seems to be going just fine. We both live with our parents and see eachother on the weekends. We have ALOT of mutual interests. Everytime one of us find a new hobbie the other one instantly like it. We are studying for the same degree but in different university and we have the same goals and values in life. We both want kids, a house in a city we both like, we think the same about mariage etc. 

The issue is, that I don't know if he is ""The one"". I mean he is such a good guy and he is so sweet with me. He's understanding, responsible, clean, good listener, he surprises me alot with gifts, he's always kissing/hugging etc. In addition we have alot in common so we almost never fight and never have to compromise over activities or other things....but I just have a doubt. I dont know if it's the fact that I've never had a relationship before him so I can't compare.

Sometimes I do find him boring. I wish he could be more outgoing with a better sense of humour and be more charismatic. He doesn't talk alot. He is more like the typical geek that talks alot when the discussion is about video games/internet/movies but remains silent when the discussion goes in other subjects. So it can be kind of awkward when we are with my friends or my family that aren't geek at all. 

I talked to him about this issue. He said that it's just the way he is and he doesn't feel comfortable doing small talks about things he doesnt care.

TITLE: Me [18F] with my boyfriend [19M] of almost 3 years having issues with communication, near breaking point.
POST: This is my first post on Reddit, so bear with me.

I have been dating my boyfriend seriously for almost three years.  Up until recently, it's been an amazing relationship with nothing to worry about.  Our parents are on board and we're in it for the long run.  Unfortunately, what I thought would last a lifetime is starting to fall apart around me, and I don't know what to do about it.

About a week ago, we fought. Of course, couples fight, no big deal.  This fight was different.  It almost ended the relationship I thought I would be in until I died, and I'm not sure how to bounce back from it.  

Communication is a huge problem for us.  Ever since our relationship started 3 years ago, we've been texting constantly.  The texting is the thing that makes what would have been nothing, something.

This time, I, being a typical girl, overreacted about something stupid, and the fight kept getting deeper and deeper until it was about something completely different, but still important to me.  

After talking things through, we decided to stop texting completely.  We call each other at least once a day, and we attempt to Skype whenever possible (although the Skype thing hasn't happened yet).  Both of our schedules are semi-busy, so that doesn't help.

I'm someone that, when someone upsets me, it's extremely hard to get over it and act like everything is fine.  He is somebody that tries to forgive and forget right away.  They say opposites attract, but I think we may have reached our breaking point, no matter how hard we try to prevent it.

My boyfriend is also very unmotivated. I worry about his future (which is also my future) to the point where I become a ""mother"" to him.

I am good friends with both parties and I had developed feelings for my friend's ex over time. I see that we are very compatible and have same interests. I just feel it's impossible for me to tell her because she just got out of the relationship with my friend. Let alone I don't know how my friend would feel about me trying date his ex. Plus I think she needs some time off from dating. I know I shouldn't say anything but feelings have been developing for a while and I feel like im gonna explode. The worse part I have been comforting her after the breakup which makes me have stronger feelings for her. I just want to get over her, should I slowly stop talking to her and defriend her eventually. It's hard being close with both friends and I am literally in the middle of the breakup / situation. At the same time, I said I will still be friends with her even if they ever break up and I don't want to seem like a liar. I'm just frustrated that I can't tell how I feel so I can get rejected and move on or progress depending on her reaction. Shes already a not emotionally stable and this would make it worse.

Although we didn't have a lot of things in common, it was easy for us to talk and laugh with one another which was great. Throughout these years I've known her, I'm always really comfortable around her and would tell her anything. 

Recently we got into an argument and we realized how much we were different from one another. Throughout our relationship, there were petty differences such as food and music, but after that argument, I realized it was much more than that. Our values are different. After the talk, she dropped the bomb of ""do you see us being together in the long run?"" and I said yes and that was the end of that night around 2 weeks ago. 

After that night, everything has been normal. We still talk a lot and text a lot. But that question she asked that night has been in the back of my mind every single day because I'm not sure if ""yes"" was exactly the right answer. I'm afraid that if I end things with her, I'm not only just going to lose my girlfriend, I'm going to be losing my best friend as well. She has given me so much in this relationship and has really changed my life for the better. Not to mention that she was also my first kiss, first girlfriend, and a first for many other things if you know what I mean ;)

Throughout our relationship, there were petty differences such as food and music, but after that argument, I realized it was much more than that. Our values are different. After the talk, she dropped the bomb of ""do you see us being together in the long run?"" and I said yes and that was the end of that night around 2 weeks ago. 

After that night, everything has been normal. We still talk a lot and text a lot. But that question she asked that night has been in the back of my mind every single day because I'm not sure if ""yes"" was exactly the right answer. I'm afraid that if I end things with her, I'm not only just going to lose my girlfriend, I'm going to be losing my best friend as well. She has given me so much in this relationship and has really changed my life for the better. Not to mention that she was also my first kiss, first girlfriend, and a first for many other things if you know what I mean ;) 

So yeah, I don't exactly know what to do in this situation. Do I love her? Yes, I do but I don't know... I have the feeling that she loves me A LOT more than I love her.  Is this just some ""phase"" I'm going through because we've been going out for so long? Is it because I'm in college and I'm surrounded by so many new people? I don't know... please give me some advice and help me out here.

TITLE: Washington DC, USA: Ex-manager defrauded a charity. If he's convicted/pleads guilty, will some of the fine be restitution?
POST: I work at a consignment shop that funds a charity. A couple of months ago I received a tip that our manager, who had been at the shop for about 12 years, had been committing fraud for almost that long. My tipster gave me a flash drive filled with evidence, which I used to prepare an info packet, which I sent to the home office.

The manager's crimes were of a few different types: 

1. He misappropriated funds that belonged to the charity in order to purchase expensive items from the shop.

2. He created fake accounts to sell his own items, and perhaps items that had been donated to the shop, at terms extremely favorable to him; in some cases he took 100% of the proceeds. He thus committed check fraud by then cashing the checks for these non-existent consignors. He once used the name of a friend of his, thus forging her signature and impersonating her. 

3. He sometimes would simply remove the sales tax from the transaction, thus committing tax fraud.

He was quickly fired, and the investigations are almost done. A few different committees will meet later this month, and the Board of Directors has the final say on how to proceed. 

So, people at the charity would like to recover what was taken, on top of what the higher-ups had to spend on investigations and such. They are also concerned with preventing this from happening to any other non-profit, because as of right now the ex-manager is apparently telling people that he quit because of conflicts with the home office. He could probably get another, similar job, and nobody would be the wiser. It's critical for our charity to save its reputation, because that affects nearly everything.

Apparently a civil suit will be unlikely, since it would cost much more in legal costs and forensic investigation than the charity could ever recover. However, it won't cost them anything to file a police report. 

So,

POST: EDIT: I know I used ""is"" instead of ""are"" in the title. Realized after the fact I didn't correct it.

I spent... 4 years without even touching a girl in any way romantic. Last time I tried dating, I was burned that badly by manipulative women. Now I'm trying again in a new city 500 miles away. 
Well. Since then, I have managed to have ""flings"" with 7 women in only 5 months. This is absolutely insane for me in the first place, because I never had a single date before this. And even now there aren't dates. Things are weird.

Every girl -except for one- has had a boyfriend. Every single one. I'm not trying to date/bang/get with women who are in relationships. I just find out after the fact they ""forget"" to tell me they're in a relationship, or they are polyamourous. 

Disclaimer: first girl was just using me to get over a breakup and moved to another state shortly after.

Now. Polyamourous relationships. I've not met a girl who was really ""polyamorous"". the 3 girls that told me that, ended up just using me to fill the void left by a bad boyfriend, for second plans when their main boyfriend bailed on them, or were too busy and they were horny.

I am tired of this, honestly. I'm getting ready to go another long time before I feel like asking women for their numbers, or to do something after whatever event we meet at. 

I don't give a damn really about sex. I just want a relationship. Someone I can grow and share all the stuff I'm doing with.

So do I just have bad luck, or is this just how the age group (19-25) is?

TITLE: Training up from less than zero. Advice?
POST: On April 24, I slipped in the shower and herniated a disc. After three weeks horizontal with extreme sciatic pain, I finally found a doctor who was interested in helping me. On Wednesday (3 days ago as I write this), I had lumbar microdiscectomy surgery, releasing the pressure crushing my sciatic nerve and immediately relieving the pain. 

So now I'm recovering from surgery. My doc has me walking--he wants me to work up to a mile a day by my follow up appointment in three weeks. But right now my energy level is so low, I did about 1/5 mile today and have been wiped out totally. 

From being bedridden for literally three weeks, I've lost a noticeable amount of muscle. When I sit, I feel my butt bones in a way I never have before. By the end of my walk today my thighs were shaking. 

Here's my plan. I'm going to celebrate the anniversary of the accident by running my second half marathon. My doctor is on board with this as long as my aerobics is non-impact until six months post-op. So I'm now treating my walking assignment as the very beginning of my training for the half. 

The other thing is, the race I want to do is April 20 in Salt Lake City, where a lot of my family is. That's 4500 feet. My training will be happening around my home in Greensboro, NC, at 800 feet. So there's that.

So got to her door and left without a hug or anything, it was a little awkward although I'm not sure in what way. We're now friends on Facebook, and have exchanged a couple of messages.

TITLE: Me [26 F] with my boyfriend [28 M] of 4 months, it bothers me that he plays video games while on the phone with me.
POST: Let me start off by saying that, in general, my boyfriend is really great. He treats me very well and is attentive and affectionate when we are together. He has always been an avid gamer but when I'm with him, he will focus on spending time with me. We see each other twice a week and on the days we aren't together, he calls me sometimes. However, it usually turns out to be talking on my part while he's playing his games. He replies and does sort of make conversation, but I can tell he's not all there and this bothers me. 

My question is, is it reasonable for me to let him know that I don't mind him gaming, but I would appreciate a short conversation with his full attention over long conversations where he's focused on a game? I dont want to seem controlling or needy. 

Also, another concern is that, we haven't been together for that long, so I cant help thinking that if he's 'falling in love' and really into me, wouldnt he be putting his game aside when he calls me? We do give each other space, so it's not that I'm asking for all his time. 

When we're together, everything is great and the things he does for me show he really cares but when we're not together, he doesn't give me his full attention when we talk. This worries me because I have definitely fallen for him, and I'm not sure if he's getting there.

Also, another concern is that, we haven't been together for that long, so I cant help thinking that if he's 'falling in love' and really into me, wouldnt he be putting his game aside when he calls me? We do give each other space, so it's not that I'm asking for all his time. 

When we're together, everything is great and the things he does for me show he really cares but when we're not together, he doesn't give me his full attention when we talk. This worries me because I have definitely fallen for him, and I'm not sure if he's getting there. 

Any opinion and advice will be appreciated!

POST: It all started in early high school when I started obsessing over girls. Back in those days, I was confident and not nervous. I was the star Linebacker on my football team and it made my confidence high. During the time, I had many girls approach me (I didn't have to work for it). Most of them were obsessed and stalked me around the school. Many of my peers would make fun of me for always being around ugly girls (they would stalk me). Although I had all the ugly girls stalk me, the hot ones thought I was a creeper/weirdo. I do have Aspergers and was in Special Ed in highschool. 
    
   Over the years, I was bullied so much that my confidence shrunk to the point that I wanted to kill myself. Even if I fought the bully (I always won by KO), nothing would happen. I started to put girls above me. By my senior year, I realized that I haven't gotten any girls yet. I then started to seriously look for girls and started talking to them. Of course, I came out empty handed.
   
   During my later/end of highschool, I missed out on spring break and quit the football team. I had no friends and was too scared to leave the house. I only went to school twice on my last highschool semester. The worst part was prom. I asked out many girls to prom and got rejected. This happened so much that I missed prom. I really regret my decisions.
      
   Now, I am a college student that is still a kissless guy. I go to parties every weekend and end up getting kicked out. I have tried many ways to solve my anxiety/confidence issues. For example, I would see a therapist. I saw 10 therapist and no one helped. I also box professionally now (Only make $10K a year) and still single. Boxing did help my confindece a little bit. I am not scared to leave my house anymore. I got confident enough and started asking out girls. I ended up getting rejected by over 100 girls.

POST: So this happened earlier today and I'm still cringing inside.

Today was the day of my great Aunties wedding. I'm not the type of guy who likes to get dressed up all fancy like but I thought I'd make an effort to look nice so as not to embarrass the rest of my family. So there we we were, everyone from my brothers to great uncles and cousins and other people I can't even remember. Before the start of the ceremony, the vicar warns us to turn off or switch our mobiles to silent. I whip out my crapberry and turn it off. In comes my Auntie looking lovely in her gown. We sing some hymns, you know the average stuff. Everything goes fine *yadayada*.

This is where I fucked up.

As the vicar goes through all the technicalities, I'm getting a little restless. It was hot, I was sweating and my hips were aching after standing up for so long ( I have recurring problems with my hips )
I shuffle around a little, trying to make as little noise as possible. Then I plunge my hands into the depths of my trouser pockets. The vicar nears the end of his lines.

*If anyone here knows of any reason why these two should not be wed, speak now*

FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY

 My phone had turned back on and with that, I received all the text messages that had been sent to me whilst it was switched off.
That was it, I flipped my shit. Head down, I ran from that church as quickly as I could, all the stone faced stares of distant relatives boring into the back of me.
Needless to say, I decided against going to the evening reception. Everyone's giving me the cold shoulder so I'm just going to sit in my bedroom, have a cold pint and wait for all this to blow over.

POST: I think my roommate is depressed. For the past two weeks, he has skipped all his finals and laid in bed staring at the ceiling. He has literally not moved from the bed and mostly ignores my attempt to make conversation. He occasionally gets up to use the bathroom or drink water. Then he goes back to bed and sleeps or looks at the ceiling. 

I thought this would last last two days, but it has been two weeks and he looks/smells terrible. 

We are not on campus housing, so there is no RA to tell. His parents call him, but he ignores them and let's the phone ring. The phone is now out of power, so they don't call anymore. I'm tempted to call his parents, but I'm not sure if he'll stop me though it's worth a try. 

Any suggestions on what to say to him and what to do? I'm not sure if he's intending to simply waste away and die. Looking at him honestly freaks me out a little.

We have a first date planned for Valentine's day.

We've been talking lately and she was unsure of what she wanted due to her moving and a bad relationship that ended a few months ago.

Well tonight we talked, and basically she wants to start an exclusive casual thing, and then we can see if we want to make it a full relationship or keep it casual. The thing is, before we do any of that and while we're still technically single, she wants to hook up with another guy no strings attached.

I've never hooked up, and honestly she'd be my first for about everything, but I know if I said no her and I would probably not work. So I stayed understanding and made it clear I want to be exclusive once we start casual dating/a relationship and she agreed.

POST: So the break-up was more or less mutual, although she brought it up. But she seemed to struggle with it more.

She was the one initiating contact, etc.

Then maybe 2-3 weeks after our break-up she already found a guy. She's been hanging out with him damn near every day now, and people say that it's a rebound, but is it?

She's clearly dressing better and exercising, etc for him.

My issue, is she is seeming more distant and I've noticed dishonesty (omitting things too), and her behavior has been selfish/cold. 

I understand people get a bit weird after the breakup.
But, she is the one that initiates contact. 

I feel like she first used me to get over me, and now has this guy to distract her.

My issue is, I loved the person she was when we were together. But the person she is now is really throwing me off.

I'm not trying to get back with her, I just want my friend back. Her and I were basically best friends for 2 years before we hooked up.
I was just wondering if you all had some insight. Is it something that just needs more time?

She basically omits the hanging out with this guy (although I know it's daily through mutual friends, and she stays over all the time), but she is the one initiating contact like suggesting lunch, which we've done every 2 weeks or so.

TITLE: Ladies, looking for insight. Me [28 M] with my ex-gf [28 F] of 3 years, broke up but want to stay friends. 4 months after our break-up, I'm confused with HER behavior.
POST: So the break-up was more or less mutual, although she brought it up. But she seemed to struggle with it more.

She was the one initiating contact, etc.

Then maybe 2-3 weeks after our break-up she already found a guy. She's been hanging out with him damn near every day now, and people say that it's a rebound, but is it?

She's clearly dressing better and exercising, etc for him.

My issue, is she is seeming more distant and I've noticed dishonesty (omitting things too), and her behavior has been selfish/cold. 

I understand people get a bit weird after the breakup.
But, she is the one that initiates contact. 

I feel like she first used me to get over me, and now has this guy to distract her.

My issue is, I loved the person she was when we were together. But the person she is now is really throwing me off.

I'm not trying to get back with her, I just want my friend back. Her and I were basically best friends for 2 years before we hooked up.
I was just wondering if you all had some insight. Is it something that just needs more time?

She basically omits the hanging out with this guy (although I know it's daily through mutual friends, and she stays over all the time), but she is the one initiating contact like suggesting lunch, which we've done every 2 weeks or so.

It's weird when the person you knew so well all of a sudden acts so differently.

She duly obliged and started pleasuring me while i was taking her home...from her boyfriends house. We ended up pulling over and having some pretty steamy car sex before i dropped her off and returned to the party.

I felt like a complete dick for what i did, and it still embarrasses me to think about it now. The worst thing about the whole situation was that the guy whose girlfriend i boned was actually one of the nicest people you could ask to meet, but at that age your dick overrides your brain.

POST: *backstory *
Bf and I have been together for 8 months. Do not live together yet be we have been discussing it and were planning on me moving in at the end of the summer. Last Friday he had a female friend come over that he has known for 10 years. I was there too and we hung out in the back yard and had a bonfire. She slept over since she does not have a car and my bf picked her up and there was also a bit of drinking at the bonfire.

Fast forward to this morning. I opened up my bf's laptop that's plugged into the tv to watch a movie. I plugged in the hard drive and was waiting for it to show up on the screen when I saw some photos on the desktop that were of someone in his bathroom. I clicked on them and both images were of his female friend in his bathroom. One was of her naked, the other clothed. They appeared to be taken with a hidden camera that was in his bathroom closet. I checked to see if it was there and it was not. These photos were taken Friday night when she was changing into pajamas.

I'm....at a loss words for how I feel. Pretty much every emotion at once. I plan on talking to him about this when he gets off work. 

I need advice. How do I start this conversation? I'm trying not to let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely love this man but I am so sickened by what I found. I've been going back and forth between devastated and absolute fury. I just feel so lost I don't know what direction I should go.

TITLE: How should I handle this hit and run?
POST: While trying to drive home last night, my car got stuck in a steep curve covered in ice. I couldn't turn around to park at the bottom of the hill, so I backed as far out of the curve as possible and left it there for the night. The car was completely off the road.

When I walked down to move it this morning, I noticed it had been hit, denting the fender pretty badly. It had obviously been hit by someone coming down the hill. My boyfriend found a note stuck in a window that said ""DUDE SERIOUSLY? Move your car IDIOT."" I'm not a prideful person, I realize that I was not parked in the best spot, but if I could have moved my car, I would have.

Is it petty to try to find this person and get my car fixed through insurance? My car is already pretty beat up, and I was prepared to just let it go, but I'm feeling pretty pissed about the note. I understand their car probably slipped on ice and they got freaked out/pissed off. I'm sure they didn't hit my car on purpose. But I never would have left someone a shitty note, I would have left my name and number. I live in a small neighborhood, so I am positive I can find out who they are. But before I go to the trouble of filing a claim, I want some objective opinions on whose fault it really is.

POST: So my GF works at a place that you need a permit (or fill a meter) to park with during work hours. A male coworker doesn't have a permit, so he will pick her up and use her permit to park with. I have voiced my disapproval with the practice before, but ultimately it turned in to the age old argument of ""you don't trust me, you're jealous for no reason"". So she continued to carpool. 

Yesterday she texted me saying she was getting a drink with coworkers and will be back soon. I didn't respond, and four and a half hours later she came back home. I was pissed and didn't really want to talk. She asked me how my day was and so forth. I gave one word answers. She knew i was pissed and didn't talk about her drinks with coworkers.

Basically I'm concerned that she may be unfaithful. She was married when I met her, so I know she is willing to cheat. With us it started with getting drinks after class. Is this guy a threat? How should I handle this? Am I just being an immature little shit? 

It is also worth nothing that things have been a little rocky/weird as of late. She won't get dinner with my family for no good reason, she used to always go when invited. I was on vacation for a week and she didn't contact me the entire time. She gave me a baby ultimatum (I need to promise her kids within three years, i told her idk maybe).

TITLE: F(22) 18 weeks pregnant going through a somewhat breakup with M(22)
POST: I call it a somewhat breakup because we're not broken up yet. Just not romantically involved. Honestly.. I have no fucking idea what's going on. 

Here is what's been happening...

For the past 2 weeks my boyfriend has been incredibly distant and he cut off complete affection. He gave me a kiss on the cheek here and there. No sex. No nothing. We've been dating for 2 years maybe. For 1 1/2 years everything was great. We had our bumps. But never this bumpy.. Until we moved. So I started going with my gut feeling that he was going to leave me or he stopped loving me. I didn't want to believe it. We have so many plans. So eventually, today... I was fed up with how cold and distant he was being. I sat next to him and asked him what was going on with him, you can tell me anything etc. And he just kept saying nothing. But I finally got it out of him. He said he doesn't love me anymore. 

I really wanted to be proven wrong that I was just overthinking. But that's not what happened. He said nothing caused him to not love me anymore, that he cares a lot about me etc. I don't want to believe it. I'm not the type of woman to beg a man to stay with me. But with him I kind of negotiated to him waiting it out another month. I think it may be because we've been around each other 24/7. He starts school in 2 weeks and I start a new job in a few days. I think things will be different then. Am I wrong? Should I not even bother getting my hopes up that he will magically love me again or think more throughly about this? Should I not waste our time with the waiting it out? I'm so confused and a little devastated.

TITLE: I [23 M] am dealing with the continual repercussions of being raised by an abusive mother. Dating life in particular.
POST: My mom and I have never gotten along. I was her first child, and I was subject to a lot of verbal abuse, minor physical abuse, and constant manipulation etc while growing up. I was beaten before I was big enough to defend myself, told what a terrible ungrateful person I was on a regular basis, that I was a mistake etc... You get the picture. When I moved out several years ago I limited my contact with her to letters or emails. After a couple of years it seemed like she may have overcome a lot of her issues with me so I reestablished contact. This led to one of her worst episodes and me cutting off communication with her completely. I have no contact with her at this point though she hopes to reestablish our relationship in the future.

I am very close with my younger siblings, and will spend time with them when I can. I feel very protective of them and try to reaffirm their worth, and that they are loved etc. because I believe not having that knowledge while growing up has scarred me to this day. I was very insecure growing up. I had a couple of girlfriends, but they were usually just as broken as I was and they were not happy relationships. I also faced many brutal rejections from women over the years, many of which I believe were a direct result of my insecurities and self sabotage. 

I've attended therapy for a couple of years, read all the self improvement books I can get my hands on, and had some very close friends (cousins actually), that have helped me in my attempts to rebuild myself.

TITLE: What alternative ways do you know of getting out of debt usually not thought of?
POST: Well Hello there,

So, I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right area, or correctly at all because this question is more specific than general. But here goes. I was going to college. I came from out of state, but because my mom was receiving public assistance (Food Stamps), I was able to change my residency to in-state. There was a gap of ~5k in tuition, which they auto deposited to my bank account. Sweet. Bills paid, stupid expenditures, a move and a month later, they came back because that money was never supposed to go to me. And so. Here I am. About a year later, I've tried to get loans (bad credit), borrow from an affluent friend (Too large a sum for comfort ability), and I can't get any student loans because I'm no longer enrolled. They froze my student account so I couldn't register for classes when it happened. Obviously, it's life. I screwed up. Bad JustaaGuy. But I'm trying to get back into school, sometime before my brain loses momentum and college becomes harder than it already is. And I don't want to get lured into a routine where I don't go. Yes, I can save and pay off slowly with excess money from my check, but it would take me close to 2-4 years by what I can afford over time. Meanwhile, the sum continues to grow. Now I'm at 7k because of late fees and collection fees. So, I thought I'd ask Reddit to see if anyone has any ideas I haven't tried or has had this happen to them before. I thought about selling my kidney in Iran, but I don't know. Those alleyway doctor types look shady. Thanks for reading.

TITLE: I [20/M] am scared of breaking up with my girlfriend [19/F] after 11 months
POST: So when I started dating my current gf (who is also my first one) almost a year ago things were more than great. She said she finally found a good boyfriend who cares for her and treats her well and I got together with the girl I had a crush on.

In the past 2 months we started arguing quite a lot and she made me feel miserable and lost. She always apologizes and tells me how scared she is to lose me. I don't just want to throw everything away, but I feel like it would be best for me to be alone again. What I don't think is going to happen is that she will get over it that easily. I fear she's going to drop out of school again and therefore ruining all possibilities of a good education. She doesnt have a family here, because her father lives in another country and her mother even on another continent. They both lost their custody and therefore my girlfriend lives in an apartment owned by an organisation for young women who had to get away from home because of an abusive relationship to the parents.

When she doesnt finish school now she won't be able to do it any other time because the organisation only allows the girls to stay till the age of 21.

I just don't want to ruin her life because I feel a bit unhappy. I always put other peoples well being in front of mine and I can't get myself to do otherwise. If it was only half a year till she was finished with school I'd stay with her, but its over 1.5 years and thats a god damn long time.

I dont even know what I expect to hear from you guys, but I figured it would be better to write here than do anything and just live with it.

TITLE: Need help with my relationship, I'm debating on ending it.
POST: I'm a 25 year old male, here's my story. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years. We're both 25 and have been friends since we were 18, we made the decision to start dating a few years ago. It's been a good relationship together over the past few years, but every day over the past few months I feel more and more like were just best friends that have sex occasionally. We're both in college, we both work part time, and we live together. I've felt this way ever since she asked me about marriage, and I considered it. 

I love her, but I'm not in love with her. I know for a fact that I don't want to marry her but at the same time I know that she wants to marry me. We attended a friends wedding over New Years in which we were set up by the bride/groom to catch the bouquet/garter, and all of our friends won't stop talking about how we should get married. She's asked me a couple of times now what I think about marriage and all I can say is ""I'm just not sure yet"". I don't want to crush her dreams but at the same time I don't want to be miserable marrying someone I didn't want to for the rest of my life. 

I'm happy with our dating relationship, we're both faithful and caring. We're both good roommates, and we have similar interests; but I feel as though we're both at the stage in our lives where we should be looking for the person we want to spend the rest of our lives with. I'm worried that I'm wasting her time because I know I don't feel the same way she does. Is there any solution to this?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated reddit. Thank you.

POST: My boyfriend[22M] and I[21F] have been dating for a little over a year (~14 months). He lost his mom to lung cancer about a year ago, and since then he has become completely unmotivated and irresponsible. I understand he is mourning and needs time to heal, but he's fallen into a depression that has put him into unemployment and a lot of debt. He was evicted from his house because he couldn't pay rent, so I let him move in with me. I realize this was probably a mistake because we'd been dating for less than a year at the time, but I thought it would help him get back on his feet. It hasn't. He lays around my apartment all day playing video games and watching TV. He claims he is trying to get a job, but I feel if he really were trying, he'd have one by now. I have been paying for all his needs (food, laundry, transportation, etc.) since he moved in and it is putting a serious dent in my bank account. I want to help him and be supportive, but I don't want to just become his new Mom. I've asked my boyfriend's dad to help him, but since his mother's death, his dad has completely withdrawn from life and is totally focused around his own grievances, making him useless to help my boyfriend. My friends tell me I should just put him out on the street because it would force him to help himself, but I worry about what would happen to him. He is very depressed, can't even think about his mom without crying, and can't even function if he tries to talk about her.

TITLE: Is trying to block/filter porn websites to kids a good idea?
POST: I read the other post in /r/WorldNews about regulating your kids instead of porn, and a lot of the comments seemed to agree with that idea.

I'm sure most of you grew up with the internet without *any* regulation whatsoever. You had the entire internet to explore, be it porn or whatever, but have you felt like it's been a hindrance or detrimental to your life growing up? I've been on Digg (before it 'updated'), 4chan, Reddit for years (even the deepweb a few times) and I've seen some crazy shit (more so on the latter three), but I haven't felt worse-off than if I hadn't seen those things.

TITLE: I [21m] am completely confused by my friend's [20f] behavior towards me.
POST: I met a girl a few years ago. I flirted with her not knowing she had a boyfriend but eventually found out and stopped. After they broke up she started texting me and we ended up hooking up. Nothing too serious, but it was a little awkward after. I asked her to hang out a few times (not even in a purely sexual way, I was inviting her to fun things) and she pretty much kept denying me. So I gave up. 

Recently, she keeps texting me out of the blue, which I'm pretty happy about. She seems to really put a lot of effort into the conversations which is surprising to me, but we have the same sense of humor so I like hearing from her. 

The problem is, I always ask her to hang out/go do something near the end of the conversation, and she always gives me some non-committal answer, or changes the subject with some joke that doesn't even make any sense, or worst of all just sends me an irrelevant emoji. Then I never really hear from her for a while until she wants to talk again. 

I just don't understand because she's the one texting me and flirting with me. And just for the sake of the argument, assume she actually is flirting with me. It's not really up to interpretation because sometimes its overtly sexual. Why would a person do something like that? I just don't get it. I can take rejection, and I can understand that not every girl is going to be attracted to me, or even most. But this is weird. 

The only thing I can think of is that she just wants to be friends and doesn't want to hook up, but I've never been super aggressive with that. So I think it would be a little unfounded of her to be nervous about something like that.

POST: I don't know if this goes here, but this is the closet subreddit I could find that could help me with this.

Anyway the title basically says it all.  The closer the guy is to resemble my brother, the higher the chance that I'll like and date him.  It's not that I'm into my brother or anything, but he's been my best friend my whole life, a role model and I love him unconditionally and I know it's the same for him.  We're only a year apart, so growing up everyone thought we were twins.  Same eye color, hair color, and personality.  We are majoring in the same thing, going to the same school, both graduating a year early with perfect grades.  Basically, we're the same person, different gender.

So this is where the issue lies.  Every quality my brother has, is what I want my boyfriend/future husband/whatever to have.  The height, figure, and looks of my brother mirror what I want him to have as well.

And now I've started seeing this guy.  He has the same figure, face, and qualities as my brother.  But last night hanging out with him, we were talking and suddenly I realized it that I could actually see my brothers face instead of this guys face.  It freaked me out a little bit, but didn't put me off.

I was then awakened again to him touching me in a more private place. I still wasn't fully awake, and when I did wake up completely a moment later, I wasn't sure if I dreamed it or if it really happened. At this point, he had gone home.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 months. At the beginning of dating, she had just won a fitness competition for losing 60 lbs.. she was on this big fitness kick and I found that to be a HUGE motivator in my life. We made a workout pact and decided to make a couple of wagers as well. We stuck to them for a couple of weeks, even signing up for a 5K this next weekend.

 Recently though, I've noticed her become more stressed out and she has been slacking. She confessed to me she gained 10 lbs since we've been dating (not a big deal, but still). She used to eat healthy, now she's eating more crap. I've tried to stop enabling when we go out, but it doesn't seem to do any good. I know she's a grown woman, but I'm trying to be supportive. She says she doesn't have enough time for everything in the day. 

I've been running and lifting every day. I've lost 20 lbs because of it. And honestly, I feel a little guilty because this was supposed to be a journey together. 

This isn't a relationship issue. I like her for who she is, but I want to see her back in the gym, achieving her goals. She's an office manager, a very independent woman, and sometimes stubborn in her ways. 

Any suggestions? I've tried incorporating running dates, but she doesn't always follow through.

TITLE: Issues with a platonic friend. Should I keep trying or should I just leave it be?
POST: Background: I am 22 she is 21 and we live together. We are both female.

Basically, whenever she is in a bad mood, it seems like I am the only one she feels free to be moody around. Initially I thought it was flattering, but now it's grown tiresome to be spoken to curtly and dismissively, even around mutual friends.

Her birthday was recently, and I thought I got her an amazing present, went out with her 2 nights in a row, etc. All I got by way of a thank you was a text message.

She frequently complains of not having many friends. Recently she has started bypassing me and asking my friends to hang out with her. She never invites me, it's usually my friend that gives me the scoop on the plans. I'm honestly glad that we can all be friends now, collectively, but the way she does it seems underhanded and distasteful. 

Every time I've tried to ask her something along the lines of ""are you mad at me or something,"" etc. she just shuts down or refuses to talk about it. But the reason why I am conflicted is because on some days she'll be perfectly chipper and seemingly happy to talk to me. And then the next day it's like I had done something to offend her (this is impossible because we are both students and don't necessarily interact every day).

TITLE: Parents have been married 42 years. Just found out my Dad [66 M] has a girlfriend. Advice needed.
POST: My parents have been married 42 years and I am one of seven children. My Mum called me in a fluster to tell me she found out Dad has a girlfriend. 
I was shattered at first, but then wasn't sure if I misunderstood what she was saying, as the details seemed a little ambiguous. 
I immediately phoned my closest sister and we both cried. We weren't sure what was going on exactly because by the sounds of it Mum didn't have solid proof that this ""girlfriend"" actually existed. 
A couple of weeks go by and I hear nothing else on the matter. It almost feels like maybe it was all a big misunderstanding, until my brother tells me that Dad had been gone all weekend - staying with this other woman.

I text my sister to confirm that this woman is definitely real. She replies back telling me to mind my own business. Unbeknownst to me, the day I called her to tell her, she immediately emailed Dad (she lives overseas) and asked him to tell her the truth. He did not deny that he does in fact have a girlfriend.

I honestly have no idea what to do. In one moment the marriage bond I grew up admiring was smashed to pieces. I am feeling a whole gamut of emotions - from shock to depression to ambivalence.
The thing that kills me the most is that my family is in total denial. My Mum is standing firm that she will not get a divorce. My other siblings do not seem to care so much - I don't think anyone has even told Dad that they know about this other woman. 

I honestly don't know what to do; how to process this information and maybe how to help our family move on. We are all adults, I honestly bear no hard feelings towards my father (he's still my Dad after all) but I do feel like they need to be responsible for their actions. I would be much happier if they separated and sorted their shit out so that in five years time we might all be in a better place.

Do I just accept it? Does anyone have any helpful advice or similar experiences?

TITLE: Should I [18F] sacrifice my happiness to be with my boyfriend [26M]?
POST: My boyfriend and I have been together only a few months, but we get along extremely well and are both pretty serious about our relationship. He has recently told me he is going to be moving to Tom Price in January for work and has asked if I would like to come with him. I don't.

Tom Price is a town in Western Australia, and a 17hr drive up north from Perth (where I live). It's a mining town so basically red dirt, spiders and snakes galore. You can't even drink the water there.

The thought of moving to a place like this makes me uncomfortable as I'm a huge wimp when it comes to dangerous creatures, can't stand high temperatures and get quite lonely easily. I have a stable job, a large amount of friends and family in Perth and have not lived anywhere else in my life.

I'm open to experiencing new things but I know I will be unhappy in Tom Price. I've also been in a LDR before and have not coped very well, which is why I am stuck making this decision. I don't want my boyfriend to think I am not making an effort to be with him because I really would like this to work out for us.

He will be there for at least a year, maybe even two. After the two years are up he is moving back to Miami where I have no problem moving to. By this time I will hopefully have a fair amount of money saved and obviously will be much more mature and experienced.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my friend [21 F] of 8 yrs, I worry about her terribly but don't know what to do. I'm desperate.
POST: Hi all.

Ever since I've known my closest friend she has been driven and a bit highly strung. However, she has only gotten worse over the years, or at least not better.

She immediately joined a bunch of societies at university and the huge amount of work required for them has caused her to fail many of her subjects, causing great stress.

All of her boyfriends/guys she's seen have been really gross and sleazy except one, and she always has bad breakups, causing stress. By way of example, the last guy she dated was due to go away (permanently) in 3 months. But she still dated him for some fucking reason. I tried to warn her that he was a sleaze, and that he was using her, but she ignored me and then became very angry at *me* when he inevitably broke up with her.

More recently she has finished university, but is now working a shitty  street marketing job that requires 12 hour shifts, often with no breaks. She works 40-50 hours a week.

I have hardly seen her in 2 months and my other friends haven't seen her properly in at least 6. She cancels on every plan she makes with our group at the last possible second due to tiredness. If she does come, she immediately passes out on the couch, doesn't engage with anyone and eventually goes home early.

I don't know what to do. I think she needs serious therapy. I know it might not sound that serious to many of you but she has really changed from her bubbly, energetic old self and I think she's honestly killing herself slowly. It makes me terribly sad and I can't stop worrying about it.

I can't bear the thought of doing nothing. I love her so much and I really want to help her but I'm not sure how to do it.

TITLE: My [38 M] date with a hot [21 M] went great, I think...
POST: So I'm a 38 year old gay man and just had the best night I've had in a very long time. I answered an ad on Craig's List a few days ago from a younger guy looking for a hairy/chubby older guy. I'm not bad looking but my weight has always been an issue, I'm 5'8. about 230 pounds. I'm self conscious about it and the gay ""community"" frowns upon us chubby guys. His ad was well written and it seemed genuine. I'm a hairy guy so I knew he'd like that, cause we had talked about physical attraction a little when we initially texted each other. 

Boy, was I surprised when we met! He was so hot, 6'1, 205 pounds, and I forgot to mention, he's 21 years old! The attraction was mutual and we hit it off famously. We had dinner and came back to my place where we proceeded to throw ourselves at each other the minute we walked in the door. He's a very good kisser and very passionate and sexy and all I could ask for in physical attraction. We didn't fully have sex, just a lot of very heavy petting with no clothes on.  It was wonderful really.

My question to everyone is this...What are your opinions on the age difference and just the dynamic in general? I also don't know how to proceed without scaring him off. I've never dated anyone that much younger than me. He seems mature for his age, has a part time job at a hospital and is going to school to be a teacher. So he's not lacking in the motivation department. I texted him about 30 mins after he left to make sure he made it home and told him I hoped we'd get to spend more time together, very simple and to the point. 

I have all these thoughts running through my head about how great it would be to be in a real relationship again and it would definitely be a confidence booster. I'm so happy and in lust and just wanted to share it with anyone who would read. Please comment on anything, I could use the help or a reality check.

POST: So, I was recently told that my company (a tech start up in the cable industry) is going to be hiring a second support engineer to work under me.  I've been part of the selection process in the past at other jobs, but now, for the first time, I'm going to be interviewing someone I'm going to manage. 

To make things more difficult, all the people I interview are likely going to be both older than I am (I'm 28), more diversely experienced than I am (I have a somewhat narrow job history) and worst of all, likely won't have the bulk of knowledge/skills that we're looking for.

I've been the senior engineer before, and I've been in charge before...I was a sergeant in the Army, but only over people who were legally obligated to do exactly what I say. I have a pretty good idea how I'd interview someone if I knew that they already had a general understanding of what we do...but since pretty much none of my candidates will have a background in this, it's not like I can ask ""At exactly 4AM we start seeing a very large number of error 0x12 (18), walk me through your troubleshooting process"".

We both had exams in this period so we couldn't meet up, but he was the one who asked if we could go for a drink (I got out of a relationship a few months earlier and wanted to take things easy with dating...)

Exams finally passed and we saw each other again during a party. We talked untill the bar closed and we both had to look for our friends. He was a bit drunk and the next day he apologized and asked for a second 'date' so he could make up for his drunkness (it didn't bother me at all, he wasn't wasted, just happy drunk).

So we planned a second date, it went great and we kissed in the end, I really started to like this guy. Since then messages have been getting less frequent and he told me he has a lot of work for school (wich I understand), we saw each other a week later on another party, and the next midday he came over to my place and again we talked for hours. When we had to say goodbye we shared a very passionate kiss, but I don't like to kiss in public so I broke it off first and we said our goodbyes.

I asked my friend (and his) and he told me he's just a nightmare to get a hold of, but I send him last week (when he went out, my bad), to meet up, but he hasn't replied yet. I don't want to look needy so I haven't send him another text. should I?

TITLE: I [21m] and my partner [18f]of 3 years have had a bad few months, ended up with her getting drunk and cheat.
POST: Basically, I'm an student ambassador at my college,  and I was kinda flirting another girl who was also an ambassador,  partner found out,  we sorted our differences and so on.  Fast forward 5 months,  I have gotten back into pc gaming recently and my partner hasn't really mentioned anything about me gaming while she is over and relaxing on the bed.  

Today I found out she met a guy from work behind my back for a drink and to get things of her chest,  things she hasn't told me such as that I don't give her enough attention,  and that I don't show her I love her and that kinda stuff in public.  

(Now I'm not a person to be like that in public as I hate others doing it in people's faces so I didn't want to be  hypocritical.) 

Back to the point of this...  She got drunk after a point and said Co worker came onto her,  they kissed and she said  no,  but she also felt confused as she felt someone else cared for her and that she felt like she had attention,  and she went back in and kissed him,  followed by him fingering her. 

 Now she told me the day after about what happened and i got pretty angry inside,  but to keep calm I kept it in and just thought about what she said And she told me it won't happen again as she felt wrong straight after it and felt sick herself. Now I am  not one to just walk away from things when it gets tough,  so I agreed to talk over it all with her like an adult,  and we are staying together to patch things back up and have agreed to give her more attention and so on then I did before to see how things go,  and that she has to obviously earn my trust again and so on. 

I just want to know if I have been mature and made the right decision to stay with her and if anyone has been through this and if it got any better?  Tia.
TL;DR: "," What strategies have you implemented in order to earn your partner's trust back?

The last couple weeks I've been getting over her and I've been making progress in myself.

Never thought much of it,and that was months ago that she began talking to him, while we dating. I guess over the last few months they have been talking, real deep meaningful stuff and how all the stuff he has gone through. 

To be honest he sounds like an amazing person, and if she wants him then i want what her heart wants for her, even if it's not me.

POST: I know this is a deep philosophical question, but I have reasoned myself into a corner and come to some conclusions that I just cannot accept, though I am not sure why.

Why are we here? / What is the purpose of life?

I have been thinking about this more and more lately and have come to look at the question as more of what can I do to add value to life?  Or, what can I do to give my life purpose?  My problem is that anytime I try to follow this logic though, I end up with some answers that I think are non-sense or that I feel I cannot accept into my life.

I start with a statement like ""I want to help people"".  Then I reduce it to ""What can I do to help the survival of the human race?"".  But then I end up with the fact that the universe has already doomed the human race, first with the death of the sun, and then with the heat death of the universe.  When that occurs it wipe out everything that has ever been and every memory of everything.  From this you end up with a conclusion that no matter what anyone does, it adds no value to the system as it is a zero sum game.  This leads me to the conclusion that Nothing in life has any value and that there is no difference between being a doctor and a murder/rapist because in the end nothing matters.  I just cannot live my life like this.

When I try to reduce the above argument, I realize that I am operating under the assumption that things can only have value such that they add value to something else, but I haven't been able to come up with a way to convince myself that anything has an intrinsic value.

Please reddit help me out of my dead end.  I'm sure there is something wrong with my logic because I just cannot accept that how we live our lives and our actions don't matter one iota.

POST: Iam about to enter my final year at Uni. I live at home durinf the summers but live across thecountry when I am at school. In spring of last year, I had breast augmentation surgery. This was elective, so I had to pay for it, but I had been thinking about this for a REALLY long timeand it was really important to me. I realized how much time was going by without finding a meaningful partner and many of my other girlfriends at Uni now have SO's, and I figured I could do everything I could to make myself more appealing. I mean, also I'm doing more substantial stuff like yoga and meditation and trying to be more social with the greek communities here and do community service stuff. So its a whole betterment kick Ive been on. 

Anyway, since it was an elective surgery, and because my parents are EXTREMELY conservative, I paid for it myself out of my PLUS that I took out. So it's my choice, my money. Anyway, I did this while at Uni actually last spring. I did it privately, my body, so I didn't tell the family about it because I knew they would freak. Anyway, I had to come home eventually and they did FREAK and actually caused some serious problems. My mother isnt even speaking to me anymore and my father barely is. I just tried to ignore that for a few weeks, but then eventually my mom said that she was so upset that I had to move out! Now she is threatening to not pay for my senior year, which means I will have to take out more loans. I really needed this surgery and I think my mom is being unreasonable. Luckily, I was able to stay with a friend until school opens up on Tuesday but anyway, I wanted to ask if anyone has any tips on how to make my mother understand that this is my body, my decisions and I needed this?? She cries all the time whenever I try to call and just basically hangs up. Thats such a crazy over reaction. I am getting good grades, and Im not a fuck up so why disown me? I wonder if anyone else has had elective surgery and had it cause such drama.

I mean, also I'm doing more substantial stuff like yoga and meditation and trying to be more social with the greek communities here and do community service stuff. So its a whole betterment kick Ive been on. 

Anyway, since it was an elective surgery, and because my parents are EXTREMELY conservative, I paid for it myself out of my PLUS that I took out. So it's my choice, my money. Anyway, I did this while at Uni actually last spring. I did it privately, my body, so I didn't tell the family about it because I knew they would freak. Anyway, I had to come home eventually and they did FREAK and actually caused some serious problems. My mother isnt even speaking to me anymore and my father barely is. I just tried to ignore that for a few weeks, but then eventually my mom said that she was so upset that I had to move out! Now she is threatening to not pay for my senior year, which means I will have to take out more loans. I really needed this surgery and I think my mom is being unreasonable. Luckily, I was able to stay with a friend until school opens up on Tuesday but anyway, I wanted to ask if anyone has any tips on how to make my mother understand that this is my body, my decisions and I needed this?? She cries all the time whenever I try to call and just basically hangs up. Thats such a crazy over reaction. I am getting good grades, and Im not a fuck up so why disown me? I wonder if anyone else has had elective surgery and had it cause such drama.

Thanks

POST: Is this normal? I'm getting hit with depression, feeling lonely without  a solid social circle. I lost mine many years ago after not staying in touch due to some real bad depression and anxiety...
 
 Gf and I don't really have many friends, we've lost touch with many, and spend most of our time just with each other when we hang out. I have a problem developing and sustaining authentic friendships. I am introverted by nature, once I feel someone has labeled me as quiet or introverted I find it hard to be myself around them. I'd like to have a better social life (doesn't matter if it is just me or my gf also included) but find it very hard to develop into a regular socializing/hanging out routine with people when everyone already seems so solidified into their groups. 

Appreciate any advice as I'm getting tired of the routine. Jesus who would I even invite to my wedding?

TITLE: Mother tanked my credit score, whats next?
POST: When i was young, my mother opened two credit cards in my name and used them to start building my credit history. So by the time i graduated college I already had a 750 credit score. She had always paid them off on time but i never really had access to the cards or the log in to monitor the accounts.

Just this year she lost her job and without telling me built up a lot of debt on them and defaulted on both of them. I caught it right when they hit my credit report so they are still 0-30 day late payments period. I right away cancelled her cards, left the accounts open to save my oldest accounts, then payed them off but the damage is already done and my credit dropped 150 points just from that.

Is there anything else i can do to get those late payments of my account or do i need to just wait for them to drop off? I believe since i payed them entirely off right away it shouldn't take too long to go back to normal but I am in a very competitive housing market and this might make it really hard for me to even rent a apartment.
Just a note 

A) I realize i should have watched those accounts, i was young and completely forgot i had them.

B) The maxes on the cards were very low, so it wasn't a huge hit to have to pay them off, i'm just really worried about my credit history.

Also If theres nothing to do to save my credit history now, how long can i expect my credit history to be hurt from this?

POST: My girlfriend of a year and a half and I were in the basement watching a crappy Vh1 reality show when things got interesting. She indicated that she was in the mood to go down on me. Her dad and siblings were upstairs, so we were sure we'd hear if someone tried to come downstairs in time to ""put everything away"" if you know what I mean. 
Things were going great when suddenly the garage door (which leads directly into the basement) swings open, and in walks step-mom and step-grandmother. In one motion, I pull up my jeans and we both dash to the other corner of the room as if nothing had happened. We heard ""Oh, my..."" followed by the door closing. Just when we think the worst is over and it's time to recover from near-heart attacks, they both had the nerve to walk in, greet us, and make small talk. Now, I was bare-assed on the couch with my jeans pulled up to my hips, so when step-grandmom introduced herself, I could only smile and wave. On a side note, she seemed like one of those creepy grandmothers you see in movies that are profoundly interested in younger men. Anyway, Step-mom must have ""tattled"" on us because soon after, down comes her infuriated father with the eyes of an angry bull telling me to ""pack everything up"" and leave his house immediately. I obliged. I walked upstairs, got my keys and drove home.

Ok so this is a weird one, the previous owner of the house I just bought walked right through the front door while I was passed out on an air mattress in the kitchen (doing renovations, yes I have a permit). My parents left to go get some supplies from a hardware store and shortly after he just walked into the front door, he seemed pretty confused, all he did when he came in was turn on the kitchen sink, started some small talk and asked where my folks went, checked inside the bathroom, locked all the doors and then just left.

The house was originally going to be a farm house back when it was built in the 40s, but the original builders ran out of money for the property needed and sold it to the previous owner who owned both houses until the closing which was last Friday.

I'm not really sure what to do because he is an old guy whose wife recently passed, and is on his way out as well. Should I just give him the benefit of the doubt and not say anything about it?

POST: We've been dating for about 2 years. We're in a LDR while he's in graduate school. Our relationship was pretty damn good to start. But the past 6 months have been hellish. He began taking antidepressants. He said the LDR was making it hard on him but he never discussed wanting to break up nor did he come to see me. Yes, he is pretty busy but if he can go on weekend trips with his buddies then not so much. Money isn't an issue either. I honestly don't know what's wrong with him in that aspect.

The antidepressants made everything worse. He's more depressed than ever. Doesn't want to deal with the withdrawal side effects. I asked him to get help 100x but he never does. He's cold, numb, literally has zero feelings. I could never speak to him again and I'm starting to believe he'd never even notice. I just can't do it anymore. I'm dating a wall.

I've told him how I felt and get no response, really. Just that he's trying to get better. The only emotion I get from him is ""come here, take care of me. I need someone to"". But I have work. And I don't think me coming to baby him while he just sits there like a zombie will do anything. I can't even feel sorry because he doesn't get help. He will go out with his friends just fine and come back to talk with zero personality again.

I asked if it was me. He told me numerous times no that it isn't. That I'm awesome. Well, I don't know what to even do at this point. Some days he won't talk to me at all like I don't exist. And I've had it.

My question is I don't even know how to break up with someone who is so emotionally void. Should I say we're over and just block everything? Should I go no contact?

TITLE: TIFU by eating Mexican food, and having snapchat.
POST: So actually this fuck up happened last night at 10 PM but it extends over to this morning. 

To give you some insight, I'm a married man with a wife who nags every now and again for staying up too late (doing work, playing games) so when I wake up late she usually scolds me.

Yesterday my wife INSITED we have Mexican food for the 100th time this month and I insisted not because of a stomache/gerd problem I take medication for, but as a newly married man I decide to stop being whiney and give the wife what she wants.

So we both got out of work late and found a resteraunt that was still open, went in, ate whatever I wanted because why not? I'm already here, fuck my stomach problem and then we went home. 

So fast forward, im asleep in bed and the little brown giggles start rustling in my tummy, I try to ignore it because I'm dead tired and it's around 3:00 AM but then pain sets in and now im awake stumbling to the toilet half asleep. I make my way to the toilet to sit and shit and in the back of my mind I'm thinking ""man, wife is gonna be pissed that I'm awake"" so I open up my phone and go to snap chat, point the phone to my feet and record my tip toe dance with the sound of shit water spewing out of me with the tag line ""my poor little asshole"" and I send it to her.

TITLE: TIFU by eating Mexican food, and having snapchat.
POST: So actually this fuck up happened last night at 10 PM but it extends over to this morning. 

To give you some insight, I'm a married man with a wife who nags every now and again for staying up too late (doing work, playing games) so when I wake up late she usually scolds me.

Yesterday my wife INSITED we have Mexican food for the 100th time this month and I insisted not because of a stomache/gerd problem I take medication for, but as a newly married man I decide to stop being whiney and give the wife what she wants.

So we both got out of work late and found a resteraunt that was still open, went in, ate whatever I wanted because why not? I'm already here, fuck my stomach problem and then we went home. 

So fast forward, im asleep in bed and the little brown giggles start rustling in my tummy, I try to ignore it because I'm dead tired and it's around 3:00 AM but then pain sets in and now im awake stumbling to the toilet half asleep. I make my way to the toilet to sit and shit and in the back of my mind I'm thinking ""man, wife is gonna be pissed that I'm awake"" so I open up my phone and go to snap chat, point the phone to my feet and record my tip toe dance with the sound of shit water spewing out of me with the tag line ""my poor little asshole"" and I send it to her.

TITLE: How to regain trust after lying to my SO
POST: Through a series of events (I won't get specific but will admit most are my fault and most involve lying about my past..basically I was a stripper from age 19-22 and I used to party way too hard) the trust in my relationship has taken a beating. 

I've given my SO total access to my phone and my Facebook and I've cut the people who have previously been bad influences on me from my life. However he insists on asking me very detailed questions about my past, especially about things that happened over ten years ago (how am I expected to remember everything in precise detail from that long ago!??). 

I've moved on from my past, grown from it and become what I consider to be a decent adult. I don't understand why he is so concerned with what I did from 18 to 22 when we are in our thirties. He is constantly requiring corrections, stories or confessions of lies from me. This has become a daily (sometimes many times daily) occurrence and it's starting to feel like torture. 

How can I regain trust in our relationship and how can in I get him to drop the interrogating? Please help me. I desperately need help.

TITLE: Me [25/F] with my BF [27/M] 1.5 yr, should I always have to ask for an apology?
POST: Hi all, 

I have a pretty good relationship with my boyfriend for the most part. However, he can occasionally say some things that are really hurtful, especially if he is drunk. (I feel that if he better managed his drinking, our relationship would be about 1000x better. But that's a thought for another thread.) 

I'm more upset about what happens after the fact. The next morning or whatever he always wants to pretend that things didn't happen. It's not that he doesn't remember because he always does. What normally happens is that I'm obviously upset. I will wait for him to bring it up or for an apology, stew for a bit, eventually bring up what happened and why it bothered me, and ask for an apology. He basically says, ""Sorry,"" and that's about it. Topic change and I am left trying to get over what was said. 

What bothers me about this is that he'll know he said something hurtful, know that I am hurt by it, and still not take responsibility for it until I put him into a position where it's practically required. At that point, it feels like he's not sorry, he's just trying to cover it and move on. 

In contrast, if I say something to him that may even possibly be hurtful, I usually apologize and correct myself before he has time to even process what I have said. I am really thoughtful about how the things I say may affect him, and I am constantly checking in with him on how he's feeling. A lot of times I apologize for things that he isn't even bothered by, just because I worry that I have hurt him. 

I know that it's silly to expect him to read my mind and know I'm upset and apologize, but I don't think that's what's going on here. I think that he knows he is wrong and knows I am upset but would prefer to ignore it in hopes that it would go away. Should I really always have to ask for an apology to get acknowledgement of his poor behavior, or is it normal to expect someone to be empathetic and apologetic without being directly asked?

Fast forward 15 years, I [32M] got an email from a girl [31F] on a local dating site saying she was drawn to my profile, we barely exchange 10 messages before we are talking on the phone. About 30minutes into the awesome conversation I mention where I live and we very quickly work out that we knew each other. We end up talking all night and are still txt'ing now. Im on a high.

It turns out that I am one of the best memories of her life and that she often thought about me. Her words were that it was the best valentines she has ever had :) (Finding me)

Anyway we have a date coming up this Friday and my initial thought was ""Omg I have to plan an epic date"" but I am now second guessing that.

POST: We've been married ten years. Things are pretty good. But we have kids, we both work full time and on opposite shifts, we don't get a lot of quality time together.

I'm planning something for her birthday. I want romance, sweetness, the atmosphere for making her cell loved, needed, wanted. I want to sweep her off her feet again. I want her to think, ""Yeah, that's why I'm with this guy. Ahh.""

The issues:

1. Most stereotypes don't apply. She doesn't like drinking, dancing, parties, clubs, flowers, jewelry. She's shy with strangers, likes nature, hates winter, does a lot of crafts. She has anxiety, doesn't like crowds. She has a real hard time telling me what she wants. She likes for me to make all the decisions, but still often doesn't dig my decisions.

2. She has poor self image, low libido. When we're together it's great, but it's infrequent. If we're out of the house - say a hotel out of state - she's good with intimacy.

3. Budget is an issue, sad as that is.

So I went to an ENT today because my voice has been really hoarse for over a year. Before you ask why I had waited that long, I'll just go out and say it: I didn't have health insurance. Turns out I have a growth on one of my vocal cords. I'm going to have surgery to in a couple of weeks to remove the growth and to find out what it is. My doctor thinks it's a benign growth, but he informed me that he has been surprised once before (meaning someone in my age group was  diagnosed with cancer).

Normally I stick to my diet most weeks, however when there is junkfood in the house I tend to gravitate to it and eat most if not all of my share quickly. Because of this I have adopted to abstain from junk as I am aware I have a problem, constant weight fluxuations of 40lbs have been the norm for me in the past. 

Now the kicker is my career demands me to stay in shape, I have maintained this however when I weigh in I am borderline. My wife fears health problems down the line because of this. But back to the point she says that ""Normal people have junk in the house and dont eat it all at once"". I admit this is true but because I am an emotional and binge eater, I like to not have things like this in the house. My wife encouraged me to look up how to solve my problem.

POST: Im 25 and I weigh 270lbs, recently I have found an eating and exercise lifestyle that has benefitted me in loosing weight. Im at about 1lb per week. My wife and I recently got a whole cake to take home due to a celebration, after about a day I had eaten an excessive amount. Normally I stick to my diet most weeks, however when there is junkfood in the house I tend to gravitate to it and eat most if not all of my share quickly. Because of this I have adopted to abstain from junk as I am aware I have a problem, constant weight fluxuations of 40lbs have been the norm for me in the past. 

Now the kicker is my career demands me to stay in shape, I have maintained this however when I weigh in I am borderline. My wife fears health problems down the line because of this. But back to the point she says that ""Normal people have junk in the house and dont eat it all at once"". I admit this is true but because I am an emotional and binge eater, I like to not have things like this in the house. My wife encouraged me to look up how to solve my problem. I have done some research and most resources I found point to a 12 step program simmilar to AA.

I apologize if this is the wrong sub, im not sure one exists for my problem. Is there anyone who has recovered from emotional / binge eating? What resources are there? Am I wrong to not want junk in the house?
TL;DR: ", Are there any lifestyle changes you can make to help you cope with cravings and prevent binging?

TITLE: Congressional staffers of Reddit, what are the most effective ways for the public to change your bosses position about an issue?
POST: It seems that most of the larger issues being debated today in Congress result in positions being taken and lines being drawn regardless of public opinion or input. The last time I checked it's a representational democracy, however, it seems our politicians conveniently forget this point as soon as they step into office. 

It's increasingly clear to me that the citizens are largely outside observers, voices stifled by wealthy, well-funded special interest groups and corporate lobbyists eagerly writing laws and influencing (ie buying) politicians and votes. 

Will your bosses only listen to those who come bearing large bags of money and promises of future campaign contributions? Or is there still a mechanism for the public to influence your bosses vote, regardless of their own personal opinion or position? Is there some way for the average citizen to force their representative to take a position counter to their ideological instincts, simply because the majority of citizens want it that way? 

In essence how can we, the public, effectively influence their decision making process without handing over large bags of cash? Or is Money the only language anyone speaks in Washington?

POST: When I say 'mutually', neither of us actually wanted it. We've been ~200 miles apart this whole time and it got to the point where neither of us have the time or the money to maintain the level of closeness that we both need. She seemed absolutely broken when we talked it over, crying and telling me she'll never stop loving me, but on facebook she's already made comments with her friends about 'shagging' someone last weekend, and it makes me feel like fucking shit.

All through the course of our relationship she never stopped telling me that if she lost me she'd never forgive herself, if we broke up she'd never be the same, but now I just feel... forgettable. Like everything that made me special is just so easily replacable to her, and to top it off I'm still crazy in love with her.

I've never felt pain like this and for the past few hours I've been an anxious blubbering mess.

TITLE: I need to move within a month and I have ""adopted"" a feral cat in the neighborhood that relies on me for food.  Can I bring her with me without traumatizing her?
POST: I first fed the cat about 6 months ago.  I've fed her regularly ever since.  Only 1 stretch of about 3 days a couple of weeks ago did she not show up for her feedings, and I could feel/see her ribs when this happened.

I'm 90% sure I'm the only human contact she's had because of how long it took for her to let me touch her (4 months) and how timid she is around other people.  She does come in the apartment almost every time now, but only part way and every time within eyesight of the door.  She derped and shut herself in once, and upon realizing that she was shut in, had a breakdown and cornered herself.  It was very hard to get her to come out.  She wouldn't come in for quite some time after that.

I've been working towards picking her up and getting her in a carrier to get her to a vet and I had planned on doing this over the summer.  I've put it off for so long because I've worked hard to get the amount of trust I have and don't want to lose it.

Now with this move popping up on me I have to rush it.  What's the best way to go about this without traumatizing her and losing the least amount of trust?

TITLE: My (23/F) best friends (both 23/F) get mad that I don't drink much when going to the bars.
POST: Going to try to make this as short as possible. When I was in HS & college I used to drink a lot and would always drink to get drunk. This past year I was able to find my ""happy medium"" and no longer was drinking to get drunk anymore. I started dating a guy and he rarely drank, which then rubbed off on me and I would never drink. I would maybe have one glass of wine with dinner every now and again. We recently broke up and I just went home for Thanksgiving. When I go home, I like to go to the local bar to run into people I used to be friends with and just be social. I usually only will drink one drink.
Well, we went to the bar last night and I was only sipping on my drink (like usual). My best friends started nagging at me and were making points like ""you've been here for so long and we're already on our 3rd drink you're on your first still. You need to drink more."" I tell them I don't want to drink more. I can have one drink all night or not drink at all and still have fun. They both just tell me there is no point to go to the bar because, ""who goes to the bar and has one drink"" ""People go to bars to get drunk"" ""we should just be at home since you aren't drinking."" They just made me feel like shit for not wanting to drink more than one drink and that it is such a problem that I don't want to drink to ""get drunk"" anymore.
Am I being ridiculous that I don't want to drink much when going to the bars or are they just being rude and mad that I'm not like I used to be in HS/college and don't like to get as crazy as I used to? It's a stupid fight, but they really make me feel like such a belittled person since I don't drink as much as I used to.

TITLE: Issue with paycheck (Minnesota)
POST: I got a position through a temp agency to a manufacturing position about 3 months ago. Everything has been fine until last week. I work Monday-Thursday 10 hour days. Last week I was unavailable to work Thursday so I asked my boss if I could take the day off to come in on Friday (OT is available on fridays but is optional). Since I wasnt gonna be working Thursday, my paycheck would be the same as any other week. 

Well on last Friday when I was working I got a call from the temp agency telling me I would not be getting my paycheck that day because of an issue on there part and said  I would get it on Tuesday (monday was memorial day). I said that is fine and that was the end of the conversation. Got my paycheck on Tuesday (in full and with no issue) but today on Friday, my paycheck was about $50 short. 

I called the agencys 1800 number since I discovered this after hours and they told me that because I got paid twice in one week, the taxes are higher which is why my paycheck is lower. This came as a shock to me because, 1. I was not aware of this and 2. My recruiter never mentioned it. Now I am $50 short because of there mistake.

I just feel so confused and as soon as I decide to commit, I change my mind and as soon as I say we should spend time apart, I change my mind and want to propose.  In my mind, I thought of doing it on New Years or Christmas but I kept going back and forth and now they're almost over and I know she's going to start wondering what I'm waiting for.
TL;DR: ", Are there any fears or doubts you have about proposing that might be preventing you from making a decision?

TITLE: TIFU by giving an unwanted spray
POST: Like most TIFU stories this story happened years ago but it resurfaced with the telling of jokes for the season.

 Back when I was a youngling, about 7 or so, we used to have lunch in our classrooms so that our teacher could supervise our eating and ensure we were eating all of our food. 

So there I am with my friends eating lunch all merrily when my one of my friends decided to tell a joke just as I was swallowing my milk. For the life of me I can't remember the joke but all I know it was so funny to me that the milk came through mostly my nose and some of my mouth and there I am sputtering like a seal because any liquid coming through your nose with force burns like hell and I also began to choke because some of it went down the wrong pipe. when i finally catch myself, I look at my friends who are now wiping themselves in disgust and are covered in the finest of misty milky mists.  Even made one of them cry.
TL;DR: ", What was the joke that caused the milk to go up the narrator's nose

TITLE: My boyfriend [23 M] of 4 years had two girls spend the night at our apartment with him while I [21 F] am out of town.
POST: I have been out of town for a little over a week now. A few days after I left I was texting my boyfriend around 12 am and he stopped responding to me. I texted him again and no response. The next morning he called me and told me that two of his friends (girls) spent the night. 

He said that around 12 am he got a bunch of texts from both girls because one of them got into a fight with their boyfriend. For some reason they decided they had to come over to our apartment. He said they the three of them stayed up for awhile, and they spent the night at our apartment. He says the two girls slept on the floor in the living room. In the morning they went and bought him breakfast. I have only met these two girls twice, and he has only known them since this semester started in January.

When he called me I was about to board a plane so I couldn't really respond to him. Later while I was waiting for my plane to take off I texted him and told him I was upset. His response was ""I'm sorry"" and that was it. I haven't talked to him since then. He has tried calling me a few times, and sent me a few texts saying ""I love you"" and a couple of other texts unrelated. I have not answered his phone calls or responded to his texts. The family I am visiting with now says I should just ignore him while I am on vacation.

I am not sure what to do or think. I do not think it is appropriate at all to have two girls spend the night at our apartment with him while I am not there. I don't know if he just doesn't see that or he just does not care.  I don't think he would cheat on me, but he has told me he has cheated on all of his past girlfriends. I don't know if I am just being dramatic and getting upset over nothing. I don't know if I should talk to him or ignore him.

POST: I live with my girlfriend, and after a while everything got really shitty. She's constantly acts insecure and it makes her get pretty crazy. She's also super jealous. It's super unattractive, and it's made me think about breaking things off with her pretty often. It made her so unattractive to me that I despised sex with her.

Eventually I started messaging girls online and swapping pics. There was no emotional connection... It was purely an outlet for me. She found out and considers it cheating. I understand how she feels that way, but I never got any phone numbers or attempted to meet anyone. The best way I can explain it is that this was a form of porn for me. We talked it out and I agreed that I was wrong, and I wouldn't do it ever again. I even agreed that I wouldn't go to subs like gonewild or any websites remotely close to cams, etc.

Anyway, even when I feel things are going great in our relationship, she has to ruin a great day or moment by bringing up this past issue. I'm so over it. I'm literally tired of talking about it with her, because there's nothing left to discuss or say. How do I get past her insecurity? I want her trust, but I'm so tired of her constant need for reassurance. Keep in mind that her insecurity, jealousy, and lack of trust were issues before the incident. What do I do?

It is getting to the point where I can no longer make payments, have no savings or spending money. I am two months behind in rent (to my parents) and just missed two of my loan payments. I have approximately ~$85K in loans to five different lenders with payments which total some where in the $800-1K range a month. I dont know what to do but cannot keep doing what I'm doing as my income stream is not steady enough to have a future budget. I work at a restaurant with changing hours at night, and during the day I do service for an HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning, if you didnt know) whose hours vary WAY too much and I am not needed often enough. I only know if I'm working that day, and sometimes i dont get the call to almost noon, but I have no idea whether I will be working tomorrow and go from day to day with my scheduling.

TITLE: He lied or just never told me that he didn't graduate high school.
POST: We're both 30. I've been with this guy for 3 years and we have a kid together. Recently I opened his mail (this is allowed in our relationship) and he'd received a copy of his GED scores. Um. As far as I knew, he'd graduated from high school. When I mentioned that he had received this particular document, he said ""whaaaa?"" I said he'd never told me he had a ged. His reasoning was that he didn't tell me when we first met because he knew I was really smart and he was embarrassed. His reason was that halfway through his senior year, he found out that due to moving to a  school with different requirements, he wouldn't have enough credits to graduate. So he stopped going and took the test instead. 

Now, I am a college dropout. I did really well in high school and have always been considered ""smart,"" which loses a lot of its meaning when you are a grown adult without a good education. Making 25k a year. I'm not any kind of Harvard grad thinking I was dating the same. But I did think I was dating a similarly educated guy to my own level. 

Here's the thing. It's not a huge deal, as far as how it affects his career prospects or the fact that I've thought he was intelligent since we met.  But I feel like I was tricked. It would have been at least a yellow flag if he had told me when we were new. I feel like he didn't give me the chance to decide for myself what I thought of the true him. But now every time I kick his ass at trivia crack or when he refuses to have a debate or read an article I send him, I'm reminded of it and almost lose respect for him a little.

TITLE: I know absolutely nothing about cars and I need advice about mine!
POST: I have a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse. The previous owner seems to have moved the air filter from its normal position to down near my front-driver's side tire. According to the mechanic this caused my check engine light to come on and report that my Mass Air Flow sensor was malfunctioning. 

However, this isn't what I was told the first time I took it into the shop. I was told that my Mass Air Flow sensor needed to be replaced. So I said OK and it was replaced.

TITLE: [24/M] Was I an asshole here?
POST: PREFACE:  You can totally call me an asshole.  Please don't downvote the people calling me an asshole.  I need to work through this and need some honesty.

I was recently in a relationship with a girl for a year.  Things were going very well, I was even planning on moving to be with her.  (It was a LDR)  In November I started a new job and met a girl who was basically my twin, but with great boobs.  This girl and I flirted a lot and hung out non-sexually probably a half dozen times but I didn't want it to go anywhere since I was in love with my then-gf.

Fast forward to a month ago.  Two weeks before I moved to be with my ex, she calls me up and breaks up with me over the phone.  [Should include something fairly personal about me here, I have mild anti-social personality disorder.  I do not form exceptionally strong ties to people and never get sad for more than a day or so over the loss of an SO/friend.]  We talk on the phone for about an hour, she tells me that she loves me but doesn't see me being in the picture when she looks 5 years down the road and wants to end it now.  We end on good terms.

Fast forward SIX MEASLY DAYS.  The girl from work and I are hanging out and get drunk.  Pretty stinking drunk.  We kiss a little bit and the next thing I know, I'm biting her thighs teasing her before I show her my cunning linguistic skills.  A few days later and we are dating.  I make it clear to her that she isn't a rebound and that I think I have been hiding these feelings from myself for months.

My ex is furious.  She says she feels cheap because she was so easy to get over.  To make matters worse, I can be outrageously sarcastic if I think someone is being unfair with me.  I ask her, ""You dumped me.  Tell me, what was the appropriate amount of time to be emotionally devastated by my loss?""  

I know the sarcastic comment was unnecessary, but am I being an asshole, as she continues to assert?

She was suspended from school for possession of marijuana on campus, and from sheer humiliation, as well as practically being disowned by her father, she moved with her mother to Portland. Though I won't be close-minded and say that she is my soul mate and that she's the only one for me, I will admit that I care for her and think it'd be amazing to be able to go to the dance with her.

I've already presented my mother with the idea of going to Oregon, (taking a $13 dollar, four hour bus ride down to Portland and then getting a hotel for a night or two) and she has not budged thus far.

We currently have around $500k in a low interest savings account and have zero experience with brokerage accounts, 401ks, IRAs or traditional retirement savings, Help!

We are hoping for advice in how to structure our continued savings and how to plan for full time retirement.

* We are currently renting for $3.5k per month (two years left on lease) and it is important we stay in the region so are looking at minimum $2.5k rents unless we buy again.

* Our current job has volatile and seasonal income of about $100-$125k a year, and hopefully this will grow given the now full time nature of the job.

* We have paid into social security so will be receiving Medicare starting in 2017 and 2018 - our medical insurance is one of our largest expenses.

We have absolutely zero experience and don't know where to turn to set up a brokerage account, plan our level of savings, or determine the appropriate structure of our portfolio. Please help reddit, where should we turn, and what are some good resources so that we can learn about our options???

TITLE: Sexpectations too high
POST: 22 F. Last spring I broke up with my first boyfriend (2 years) based on not being able to trust him, and major ups and downs almost our entire relationship. I had also met someone else who I was fully able to trust and enjoyed being with. We dated for almost 8 months and it was great because there were major ups but no major downs. We ended up doing long distance for 3 of those months and it caused a lot of communication issues as well as just drifting apart, to the point where I don't really feel anything now that it's over, except maybe relief. Something I never fully realized throughout the relationship was that I wasn't sexually satisfied. He was more physically attractive than my previous boyfriend and their size was almost exactly the same, creepily enough. But there was something missing that my previous boyfriend had... and now that I've become interested in someone else, I'm already terrified that I won't ever be sexually satisfied because my ex set the bar so high.

POST: 22 F. Last spring I broke up with my first boyfriend (2 years) based on not being able to trust him, and major ups and downs almost our entire relationship. I had also met someone else who I was fully able to trust and enjoyed being with. We dated for almost 8 months and it was great because there were major ups but no major downs. We ended up doing long distance for 3 of those months and it caused a lot of communication issues as well as just drifting apart, to the point where I don't really feel anything now that it's over, except maybe relief. Something I never fully realized throughout the relationship was that I wasn't sexually satisfied. He was more physically attractive than my previous boyfriend and their size was almost exactly the same, creepily enough. But there was something missing that my previous boyfriend had... and now that I've become interested in someone else, I'm already terrified that I won't ever be sexually satisfied because my ex set the bar so high.

POST: I have a great relationship with a girl who I want to marry. My ex wife cheated on me and tried to hide it. We're divorced now.  I had kept in touch with my ex wife as friends and sometimes talked to her child about games etc.  Since I got a new girlfriend she did not mind me sometimes communicating with ex wife, but the child she felt threatened by.  So I gradually stopped contact because what reason to communicate with ex anyway, as now we're more serious and want to start a family with my new girl. 

But, the only thing that we fought about now is that we found out that my mom still communicates regularly with my ex wife's daughter.  My fiance is threatened because she thinks they talk about our personal life (we don't know but it's her thought,  maybe insecure but also a but understandable in a way).  Women can be very competitive especially my fiance. 

A few months ago my ma said she stopped.  But my fiance found something on social media and now she's furious.  My ex also sent a fake message from a fake profile to me making it seem  like I'm flirting ng online.  My fiance now wants nothing to do with ex wife and her child, and told me that my mom must stop or get out of our lives forever. Meaning no contact ever. 

Is this extreme or justifiable?  My mom has a history of gas lighting and lying, sort of a borderline narcissist (but she's very friendly, just lies a lot).

POST: So, I have a horrible case of dandruff, so i went to buy some of that zync whatever-the-hell shampoo. So, i'm in the shower. I put a handful on my wet hair, and first I was ""Hey this isn't so ba-"" and then BAM. This was satan's own shampoo.

 As it slowly ran across my face, I could feel the burning, as if someone lit a small fire on my face. I tried to resist it, putting water at my face. As i was rinsing, I could hear satan whisper in my ear ""its not over yet"". The damn shampoo made its way in not one BUT BOTH of my eyes. Me being the retard I am, i put my SOAP COVERED HANDS in front of my eyes to block out the stinging. Not only was satan shoving his pitchfork in both of my eyes, he was laughing. As I let out my whimpers and groans, the FUCKING SHAMPOO MADE ITS WAY INTO MY MOUTH. Be noted, while i was resisting the shampoo on my face, i put on more.

 So, as my eyes were burning, my tounge felt like it just dived in a cup of noodles fresh out of the microwave. I shoved my face toward the fresh, cold water to feel the relaxation, only for the stinging to return instantly after I move away to get air.

Now, the thing is, the water tends to shift from extreme colds to extreme heat. And oh-fucking-boy did that shit happen. As I was cleaning away the satan shampoo, the water went rogue and went HOT on my face. That was it. I GTFO'd out of the lava pit and rubbed my face with my towel and dried up.

TITLE: I [30 M] worry I am being superficial about my GF [30 F], why do I compare her looks to other girls if I love her?
POST: I hate myself for even writing this and I feel it may be a terrible idea but I have to try.

I am 30. Sheila is my gf and is also 30. We are going to get married. We love each other so much, we get on so well, we've lived together and we are so good together. When I thought our relationship was over I was devastated. It seemed like it would end because I couldn't commit.

This is my problem, or at least the symptom: I see other girls and I compare Sheila to them, and I often think ""but that other girl is more attractive and I wish Sheila looked more like that.""

I can't block them out and they plague me everyday. I WANT them to stop because I love her so much and I do find her physically attractive as well.

I want to believe it's because I'm immature and unable to appreciate things, because at least I can work on that and change myself... because I want to be with her! But I'm worried it's something more 'fundamental', that the mere fact I am writing this on the internet is terrible in itself and shows me that I don't really love her.

How do I move forward and do the right thing for both of us?

Anyway, she gave me the weirdest look that confused me.  She shook her head in confusion and answered with, ""Uhh... sentimental?""

I was kind of weirded out by her reaction so I just nodded my head and accepted the answer as is, thinking that she simply misunderstood.

For some reason, my memory brought me back to that moment and I decided to look up the definition of sentimental and came up with ""love affair.""  To my horror, I realized that this whole time she thought I was asking her for the translation to ""horny.""  I'm pretty sure she looked at me like as if I was some creep for the rest of my time in high school after that.

She has a hard time accepting it as she calls me a Unicorn (something that isn't supposed to exist). That blows my mind as I'm just being me.

Here's where it gets hard for me.  She wants it slow dead slow. Molasses is the term used often. She is terrified of investing and being crushed again. She has explained her past and I understand the concern. Not going to dive into that yet as it would push me off topic.
I am horribly scared that in this time outside factors (friends, ex's, new suitors) will pull her away from me. 

She told me her one of her greatest fears is finding a soulmate or true love and not acknowledging it out of fear and walking away.  That scares me, a lot. I'm not in love with her but I feel it will happen. She is just far to much the poster of the girl i've dreamed about since I learned about attraction.

I'm trying my hardest to slow myself down to keep her wishes and appease. But in the back of my mind its always there. Will i lose the chance i've waited for? Will someone take her away in lust and crush her again?

TITLE: Me [30M] and [29F] - For love or beauty?
POST: You'll probably think I'm a shallow, arrogant, simple-minded bastard and hate me (because I do) but here goes:

I've been with a girl on/off for nearly 10 years. She's the person I trust most, the one I'd call for if I had a day to live and I love her more than anything in the world. In short, she should be my wife and would but for that most petty & stupid of issues: beauty, I just don't find her all that attractive.

She is actually fairly good looking in the traditional sense and I don't even care much about looks, it's almost 100% down to a couple of tiny ""beauty spot"" style blemishes that I can't stop focusing on (also I don't like kissing her as she always smells/tastes a bit like peas).

She wants marriage/family but I've always felt like if I married her it would be out of duty or love, not out of true desire and so doomed to eventual failure. We've split up a couple of times because I'm hurting her by carrying on and she deserves the entire world, but she loves me and persistently ""just wants to be with me"" so the endless quagmire continues.

Over past 2 years we split up, I met and almost married a girl who I found extremely attractive (and smelt amazing), but new girl was an utter pyscho bitch and thankfully things broke down. The 1st girl is now back in my life but facts remain the same. I hate myself so much for wanting to marry some tramp just based on looks but not my solemate.

I wish more than anything I could find her as attractive as the other girl (most people would probably say she is, if not more!), but from the heart I don't and never have. What should I do? Do I need to end it with the girl for both our sakes? Is there a way to magically (or with effort) start finding someone attractive who you love?

TITLE: Touble With Being Away From Home
POST: Hey all,

In around 36 hours time I will be going back to university away from home. I'll be gone until around Christmas time (apart from the odd train journey home). The trouble I have is that I really don't want to be away from home. I've been back from uni for about 5 months now.

I've spent time living away before (this is my second year), and times even before university. Over the last couple years I've become even closer with my Mum and brothers and now I dread going away.

I know it's not for long, and I'm not exactly going far, but my mind has trouble adjusting. I'm 22 and I know a lot of people by this time have more independance and even relish the time spent away from home. However, I am not one of these people. I shoud note that my family are also not a massive fan of me being away (missing me, etc).

The question I have, is how do I deal with this in a way that doesn't drag me to the pits of unhappiness and loneliness?
Is there anything I can do to ease the stress on my family too?

I apologize if this is in the wrong subreddit; it's the only one I could think of relating to my problem.
TL;DR: "," What strategies can I use to make being away from home easier for myself?

POST: This happened about 12 years ago, when I was in grade 3. 

Email was the new thing that everyone had, and I was gloating about how I had one, and how I could email my friends and family across the world. 

Like any typical school day, my grade 3 teacher greets all the student as we come in. She asks me how I was, and if anything awesome happened over the weekend. Being the extremely talkative kid that I am, I start telling her about my Friday night cartoons, Chinese school and piano lessons on Saturday, all the chores I had to do and Sunday School as well. When I start talking about my Sunday night, I tell her: 

""I got a really strange email. It had a bunch of weird sentences, and pictures of girls with eating poop with veins in them. Like they were really dark brown and long, so it's poop... but I don't know why there were so many veins in it! They were like eating poop! They had their mouths all over it!"" (I giggled at telling my teacher it looked like they were eating poop because it sounded so ridiculous) (I also personally filtered out they had no shirts on and I could see boobs) 

She gave me the most horrid look, smiled and continued on.  Later in the day, I got a phone call home, and my parents found out that I had told my teacher and my teacher had voiced her concerns about my online... activities.

POST: A little back story we meet on Tinder last November and have been meeting up and going out spending hours with each other and things things were going go and we was enjoying time with each other. I wasn't rushing her or anything. Every time we departed we would agree to meet up again which we would do. 

We meet up 2 weeks ago and everything was great and fine we had a great time and agreed to meet up the follow week. I really should have made the move on her but I am too much of a coward. We couldn't as she had to travel to see some family but that happens. But since than she has became so distant with me. I may not have helped as we agreed to meet up this weekend just gone. However she said she may have to work so she will get back to me. This is where I messed up. 

So I waited until Friday and asked she blanked that comment and went on to ask about my day and other things so asked again with the same response and I gave up. However the next day went out with some friends got drunk as you do and well sent a line or two saying look I am sorry for asking like that. 

Now not spoken to her since Saturday night and I have noticed she has started to use tinder again a lot more logging in a lot. Where as before it had been months before she logged into it. I dunno what I can do or say to save this.  

At this point even if its over it would be nice just to be told yeah it would suck. But we had plans for stuff coming up in the next few weeks that required tickets.

POST: [original post](

First, thanks for the support, everyone. I really appreciate it.

So I talked to my landlord and my now ex - my landlord was extremely understanding, and he let me off the lease. He said my ex can either keep the apartment for himself, or pay rent until he finds another tenant. Now I just need to find a place to live because I was supposed to be moving soon...it's another thing to add to the list of things currently stressing me out at the moment but I know it can be done. 

I don't know why but I asked him why he did it and he said he couldn't give me a reason other than because he wanted to. He kept begging me to forgive him but I really can't do that. I can forgive a lot of things but I can't forgive this. I told him it was over for good and that I don't want to speak to him anymore. 

I also talked to the girl he was cheating with. She contacted me on FB and told me everything that happened. I almost feel worse for her than I do for myself, if that even makes sense. I made sure she knew that I was not mad at her. Seeing all the pictures of her and him together during times when I thought he was doing something else pretty much ripped my heart out again though. I told her to make sure she gets tested for STDs since he and I didn't use condoms. 

Emotionally, I still feel horrible. I just can't believe that I had no idea about this for an entire year. I don't know how I didn't see it? But I just didn't have any reason not to trust him... we didn't live together, so if he said he was out somewhere I believed him because like I said I just didn't have a reason not to.

What's funny is that things have been so unbelievably good with her that I actually wondered if maybe this was it for me, if she would be the one for me. I can't say that now.

I've never loved anyone before. I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to tell. She was upset last night and we talked about it until she told me she didn't want to discuss it any more and fell asleep. We talked a little more today before she left for work. She's really hurt and believes that it means she's not good enough for me, or that there's something she's doing wrong. Nothing could be further from the truth but I can't convince her of that. 

I don't want to lose her, I don't want to do anything besides make her as happy as I can and spend my time with her. I realize that doesn't carry the same weight as ""I love you."" She really meant it too, I have not known her for all that long but I know her well enough to be sure that she wouldn't say it frivolously. She told me that she doesn't regret saying it and won't apologize for it, but she doesn't want to talk about it anymore and wants things to go back to the way they were before.

What's funny is that things have been so unbelievably good with her that I actually wondered if maybe this was it for me, if she would be the one for me. I can't say that now. I was (am?) going to ask her to move in with me soon when my current lease runs out. I've never lived with a significant other before, and until now I have never wanted to.

I've never loved anyone before. I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to tell. She was upset last night and we talked about it until she told me she didn't want to discuss it any more and fell asleep. We talked a little more today before she left for work. She's really hurt and believes that it means she's not good enough for me, or that there's something she's doing wrong. Nothing could be further from the truth but I can't convince her of that. 

I don't want to lose her, I don't want to do anything besides make her as happy as I can and spend my time with her. I realize that doesn't carry the same weight as ""I love you."" She really meant it too, I have not known her for all that long but I know her well enough to be sure that she wouldn't say it frivolously. She told me that she doesn't regret saying it and won't apologize for it, but she doesn't want to talk about it anymore and wants things to go back to the way they were before. She says she ruined things. She didn't, but I feel like I am killing our relationship a little more with each word I say to her. 

I apologize if this is a little incoherent.
TL;DR: ", How can I repair the relationship after not responding when my girlfriend said 'I love you'?

TITLE: MIL to be passed this year. Should I still do Father-Daughter Dance?
POST: Hi! I should start by saying that I don't expect anyone to make this decision for me. However, I can't escape my own perspective, and I would like to hear other points of view. 

My fiance and I have been engaged since December 2012. We both wanted a long engagement, and we will be getting married on November 8th this year. Ever since we first got engaged, we both said we wanted both a Daddy-Daughter dance and a Mother-Son dance. I want the wedding to be as much about his family as about mine. 

But tragedy struck in April and his mother passed away suddenly. It was completely unexpected and horrible. It still hurts both of us very much, although we try to talk about her as much as possible. 

So, should I carry on with the Daddy-Daughter dance? I don't want it to create a sad, awful moment for my fiance. But I also don't want to let down my dad. I think my dad would understand, but I also think he's been dreaming about my wedding longer than I have. 

Any advice or thoughts are so very welcome. Thanks!

POST: Hello /r/loseit. First time poster here (been lurking). I just wanted to share - for the first time since I can remember, I don't want to cry when I step on the scale. My best friend married in August, and I was asked to be a groomsman. I made a goal with myself when he proposed that I was going to lose 50 pounds by his wedding. I failed miserably and had gained 10. I was 260 pounds and the largest I had ever been in my life. I managed to put on a brave face, but the entire weekend I couldn't get over how great everyone else looked. 

After that weekend, I stopped telling myself that ""I can't."" For years, ""I can't run"" was my excuse, and that Monday I ran 2 miles. To be fair, I downloaded the C25K app and there was walking involved in those 2 miles. It was painful, but I ran every time the app told me to. 2.5 months later, I'm still running. Tonight I ran week 5 (8 min run, 5 min walk, 8 min run) and after my shower I stood on the scale; 238 pounds. I am doing this. It's really happening.

POST: My girlfriend [20F] and I have been together for a while now. Most of it has been long distance. Due to just casual conversation before we were ever dating, my girlfriend knows that I liked another girl at Uni for some time a while ago. The thing is, this girl and I are still pretty good friends (although I have no remaining degree of attraction to her) and grab dinner in the dining hall a fair bit to catch up, as I do with all my friends. Truly nothing out of the norm. That's the extent of it. Nothing romantic ever came close to happening with this friend in the past.

I'm a bit concerned about my girlfriend being worried when she comes home though. On one hand, I don't want to throw away a (very casual) friendship with someone, but I also don't want my girlfriend to feel jealous if I'm having dinner with this friend she knows I once liked (and who my girlfriend doesn't particularly like very much). Is there any way for me to mitigate this? 

Someone on here might ask why I'm concerned if there's truly nothing to be worried about with this friend or question if my girlfriend is insecure. Both are not true. Rather, if I were in her situation I could imagine feeling a bit uncomfortable and wouldn't want her to have to feel that way. But maybe that's my own problem...

TITLE: Me [26 M] with my gf [23 F] of 17 months, she invested a lot into me and now is finding it hard to find energy for me
POST: My gf (call her Samantha) and I had a great relationship but hit a bad patch because I started to seek recognition in my sporting activity in the form of another girl. We ended up breaking up in March and I slept with the girl. I had emotionally cheated on Samantha in the lead up but then realised what I really wanted.

I told Samantha what had happened and that I was willing to win her back. I fully admit that I didn't deserve it but said I would do what it takes. Fast forward to now and I have done everything I can to win her back. The trouble is that we have developed a sort of power balance where she has all control and she is finding it hard to invest in me because of the amount she invested in me.

I know that we work well together and I know that I want her. We have talked about it and we both agreed that the power balance is wrong and that is part of why she has less attraction for me.

So my question is: what can I do to help her regain that energy for me?

TITLE: Found out boyfriend has been exchanging sexually explicit emails w/ transgender
POST: My boyfriend (29) and I (23 f) have been dating for a little over 6 months and made it official about 2 months ago.  I moved in with him about 2 weeks ago. He was married for 3 years, divorced a couple years ago due to his wife cheating on him. I have noticed he constantly seeks reassurance from others that he is sexually appealing, or ""enough""

Recently he went through my text messages looking for who knows what. He didn't find anything. My experience has taught me that usually when people are doing shady things, they project them on to you. So I looked through his phone. Found out he had been dating someone the whole time him and I were. He lied to me about this woman when I had asked if they were dating. In any case, it had ended shortly before we became ""official"" so I let it go and blamed me being upset because I was under the assumption that he was an angel. 

I got the feeling there was more upon inspecting his computer, he still kept in touch with women he met online and has Skype sex with. Sending messages about how he still fantasizes about them, etc. I also found shemale porn. Then I see his Facebook messages and see he has been exchanging sexually explicit emails with a male to female transgender. 

I confronted him about it and he felt awful and understood that he was wrong and apologized. He assured me he does want to be with me and build a life with me.

I am left feeling extremely insecure and untrusting of this man who has been openly planning a serious future with me that involves marriage etc. 

I am normally very open sexually, willing to experiment, comfortable and able to orgasm. Since these things have happened I do not enjoy bejg physical with him and I cannot orgasm.

I know that a man watching she male porn or being interested in it does not make him a homosexual. I have explored with him, I have used strap ons on him. I have been open. But the fact that he is seeking a transgender makes me feel like I am not enough. That he wants more, that maybe he does want to be with a man. That maybe Our relationship is just a front.

POST: I've been with my girl friend for 14 months and I really do adore her. She's been so good to me and has supported me through thick and thin. 

As with any SO there is a sense of property where one might think, ""Hey thats mine! Don't touch!"" or just jealousy. I totally understand both of these things as I have experienced them myself. My girlfriend is very possessive of our relationship and can get very jealous very fast. She is rather emotional. Her father cheated on her mother and left at an early age which causes her to detest lying. If anything seems even remotely off to her she will shut down. There are times where I've done nothing and she will display this reaction causing a rift between us for a brief time. Since I go to university while she is in her last year of high school, she us very suspicious of any weird activity especially regarding other girls. She gets defensive and somewhat cold towards me if I mention a girl I met as friends or other happenstance events. She reads into a lot of my actions and words which causes anxiety and doubt on her end.  She has repeated this behavior each time a girl has come into question or she suspects me of lying. Its gotten to the point where I feel very nervous after speaking to another girl over social media or in person. I feel like I am hurting her and I am so worried of her reactions since I know it will be like a bomb going off.

POST: I have three children. Two of them are male, ages 14 and 10, and my daughter is 6. I work at a church, so I'm there on the weekends, and my kids come with me because my wife also works weekends. We've been around the church for a long time, and they know a lot of people there, so they're rarely bored. 

I've known John (named changed, obviously) for about three years. He was a student in the youth group I worked at, and came back as a leader after he graduated and started going to college nearby. He also recently got hired by the church to do janitorial work during the week, and he's there on the weekends as well. 

On the weekends, I've noticed that they've started to spend more time together. She goes looking for John when we get there and almost always hugs him when she finds him. He asks her about her week, how school's going, things like that. Also, every now and then, he'll give her a Hershey's Kiss or a piece of gum and tell her it's a secret between them (but Dad has ways of finding this stuff out).  

Her school had spring break last week, so she was there with me during the day on Wednesday, and John was there as well, cleaning the building. According to Sarah, she spent about an hour with him, ""helping"" him wipe down tables in the lobby, take out the trash, all the things he normally does. I practically had to pull her away from his side when we left, and he mentioned to me that he really enjoyed having her with him as he was working.

I work at a church, so I'm there on the weekends, and my kids come with me because my wife also works weekends. We've been around the church for a long time, and they know a lot of people there, so they're rarely bored. 

I've known John (named changed, obviously) for about three years. He was a student in the youth group I worked at, and came back as a leader after he graduated and started going to college nearby. He also recently got hired by the church to do janitorial work during the week, and he's there on the weekends as well. 

On the weekends, I've noticed that they've started to spend more time together. She goes looking for John when we get there and almost always hugs him when she finds him. He asks her about her week, how school's going, things like that. Also, every now and then, he'll give her a Hershey's Kiss or a piece of gum and tell her it's a secret between them (but Dad has ways of finding this stuff out).  

Her school had spring break last week, so she was there with me during the day on Wednesday, and John was there as well, cleaning the building. According to Sarah, she spent about an hour with him, ""helping"" him wipe down tables in the lobby, take out the trash, all the things he normally does. I practically had to pull her away from his side when we left, and he mentioned to me that he really enjoyed having her with him as he was working. John also joked about wanting to borrow her on Friday (my day off) so she could keep him company. I mentioned all of the above stuff to my wife and she didn't seem too concerned, but I'm still not sure.

What do you think, /r/relationships? Should I be concerned about John?
TL;DR: ", Is there any way to set clear boundaries between John and my daughter that will make me feel comfortable?

TITLE: How do I [27M] break up with my girlfriend [24F] of one year who has no idea this is coming?
POST: I have an absolutely loving, wonderful, giving, beautiful, funny girlfriend that guys absolutely pine over who I have zero feelings for. 

We started off like any good relationship, being obsessed with each other, having her on my mind every day, always touching each other whenever we were together and just finding endless things to talk about.

Our sex is amazing, she's the funniest girl I've ever dated and at about six months in I told her I loved her. I haven't felt anything like what I felt for her in a very long time and she told me too. It was such a moment for me I even cried because I had no idea I had feelings like that in me.

Fast forward to now, she is still every bit the person I met when I started dating her. But for some reason that feeling is gone. She's still funny, wants to see me, good to be around but the spark is gone. I don't feel anything towards her. I miss her from time to time but most of the time my mind is elsewhere. 

And this is the troublesome thing. She thinks we're exactly where we were six months ago. She's making all these plans (that I was planning with her too with the same level of enthusiasm) except now I don't know how I'm going to go through with them.

I feel like I need to break up with her because I'm leading her on. I'm not sure why I don't have feelings for her anymore (I haven't met anyone else or anything like that). But I have absolutely no idea how. She's so happy to talk to me and be with me I know its going to crush her and she's going to clam up tighter than a shell.

So how do I do this as respectfully, politely and tactfully as I can? We have mutual friends and I know its going to be shit but what else can I do?

TITLE: I [22M], am having doubts about/think i got into my relationship for the wrong reason with my girlfriend [24F] of two and half years.
POST: My girlfriend and I have been together for two and a half years now, we have been relatively happy and had an overall healthy relationship...

We started dating two and a half years ago when i was going through extreme anxiety and depression, i honestly thought a cause for both of these was that i was lonely. So naturally i sought out a significant other to make me feel less lonely. It didn't really solve the problems but she was extremely supportive throughout the whole thing, and a year later i was completely over the anxiety and depression. Over that year i developed a lovely relationship with her, and i learned to care for her deeply. 

However, once my anxiety and depression ended, i started to notice that i was having less fun with her, i was more eager to do the things i was doing before anxiety and depression took over. Less eager to do things with her. So it's quickly turned into me being sort of annoyed when im with her. On top of all this we both live very busy lives, we are both art majors at a school in Vermont, and constantly have work to do where we are only seeing eachother a couple times a week. 

I've been considering asking for a break, to really sort things out. And this is where my question comes into play... Can you have a break like this, especially one that will be super one sided (she will not want to do it, she's really attached) and go back to having a normal relationship after? I feel like our relationship will not be as strong.

The other option is just a complete break up and have it be done and over with. 

Has anyone been in similar situations that can offer some advice?

TITLE: Me [36 M] with my ex-girlfriend's [37 F] brother duration 3 years - Broke up with Girlfriend, but was friends first with brother for 6 years. He is pissed at me.
POST: So I broke up with my girlfriend of almost 3 years. We were both previously divorced. She changed as a person, started giving me a hard time about working late and hanging out with my friends. Decided to end it. My ex-wife was controlling and I was a little bitch who let her. I promised myself that I would never be controlled in a relationship again. 

I manned up, met her in person, apologized and said that it wasn't working out and that I wished things were different. Broke up 3 months ago. There was no cheating (that I am aware of anyway!), no abuse from anyone... it just wasn't right anymore - we barely even fought. I went no contact since that time. While she has texted me a few times since, I have not responded. 

The problem:

Her brother was a casual friend. I was in a band with him for a bit a bit and he is friends with some mutual friends as well. I also go mountain biking with him and other friends. His wife set me up with his sister. I didn't know it was his sister, she just called it a blind date. I found out on that date, but I was having a good time and decided to continue on. I don't think I would have gone on the date if I knew it was his sister.

I found out from a mutual friend that he is pissed at me and refuses to hang out with me in the future. 

My question is, should I contact him and try and smooth things over? Or should I just continue to let things settle down? I wasn't mean or anything during the break up. I have a feeling his wife is just being a jerk. I just don't want to cause problems between the rest of the few friends I have and barely see. I am alone most of the time when I don't have my boys with me and don't want to lose more friends. 

Any advice is super appreciated.

TITLE: Why is weakness considered such a negative trait?
POST: I'm serious in asking this. I realize it seems like a stupid question, but something I've noticed in society and interpersonal relationships is that if you need help or present yourself as desperate or ""weak"", people really want nothing to do with you. Why, though? 

I mean, when my friends have needed someone to talk to or help through difficult times, I've been there, supported them, etc. But when I've had difficult times, really bad fucking times, I am accused by them of giving them too much drama to deal with, and they basically stop being my friend after awhile. 

Same thing with relationships. As long as you're strong, hold your own, support the other person, you're fine, but the minute you look like ""you haven't got your shit together"", the other person is ready to bolt. 
And in searching for jobs, if we're honest and just say, I am desperate for work...people don't want to hire you. So you have to put up a front and basically act like you're self-reliant no matter what. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, why is it so admired by society to be self-reliant and not need anyone else's help or support...when all of us clearly do need one another to thrive as human beings...
It's a stupid question ultimately, but I still can't understand why. I was raised a spoiled only child, and that probably has something to do with it. I was rewarded anytime I asked or begged for something, and then I realized the rest of the world doesn't work that way.

POST: In our pasts my SO and I used to be smokers (before we dated). When we first met, we enjoyed smoking together and talking outside getting to know each other.  This only lasted about a month before we both decided we didn't want to pick up the habit anymore.  I have stayed with this decision (for certain medical reasons especially) but he has wavered.

I have never caught him in any other lie besides this one but to repeat the same lie when we talked about it really hurts.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar?

TITLE: My(26) BF's(29) father lost his job, BF wants to move in with them to help
POST: Boyfriend(29) and I(26) have been dating for 5+ yrs. We have a son. We were planning to buy a house later this year. We had some money saved, plus we let his parents borrow $3500 a few months ago that would be repaid(now I don't think we'll be seeing it again). Then, his father(let's call him Asius?) lost his job.

Asius and his wife(Leda) both worked, but Asius was the main breadwinner. Leda works for the government making $33k/yr. BF has us moving in with them to help, instead of having our own apartment. Their mortgage is $1300/mo, both cars paid off, no other debts that I know of. 

Basically, I don't want to live with them. I wonder if they could live off what they have or if we'd put them in a bad position if we don't live with them and pay rent? Asius could probably get unemployment benefits, I'm not sure. I guess my biggest gripe is that Leda, and Asius to an extent, spend money on needless things. Cable tv plus netflix, multiple vacations a year, eating out every week, random expensive stuff. BF and I live almost on the basic necessities, though we do spend sometimes. So obviously it would aggravate me to see them continue to waste money(granted, it's not like they buy diamonds and new cars) right in front of us while we live our frugal lives. They also expect us to do errands and stuff for them because we're younger.

Should I try living with them for a while? Let them get through this own their own? What do you think? Am I being selfish?

I sort of hate my life right now. I'm sure I'd hate it even more if I had to live under someone else's roof like a child. I really need that safe haven of my own, where I feel secure and comfortable. I know everyone isn't like that.
TL;DR: "," How can Asius and Leda get through this difficult period without relying on their son's help? 
2. Is there a way for the family to reduce their expenses and still maintain their standard of living? 
3. What are some creative solutions that will allow the couple to save money and still take care of their son?"

POST: No long story really. I met a girl at ballroom dancing club and asked her out to lunch. The conversation was mediocre, but I had fun and am still interested. I get the feeling that both of us are a bit awkward which explains the poor conversation.

Today, I text her asking how her weekend was and she responds and ask if I want to grab lunch. Conversation was better than the last time, but I get the feeling I am moving towards the friendzone based upon some of the conversation. Specifically, she asked if I wanted to see Star Wars in 3D with her and maybe some of her friends. She specifically mentioned one of her roommate's (male) friends as going.

I told my girlfriend about it and my girlfriend told me she was uncomfortable with me going and would really prefer if I didn't go. I got really mad at her and we didn't talk for a few days.

And he tells her (not realizing she didn't know) that I had slept with my ex.

Anyways,  My mother is not long for this world (chronic smoker her whole life, and is now suffering the consequences) and I know I need to get some of her affairs in order while I still have the mental capacity to do so.

She owns a mobile home and a couple acres of land (she owes nothing on them). Her condition has gotten to the point where she will need to move in with me and will require in home care.  She basically has no assets aside from the land since the mobile home is in pretty bad condition (could probably get it condemned).  She is on disability and medicaid with no other source of income.

My main concern is what will happen to the property when she passes?

TITLE: Is rape really worse than murder? Details inside
POST: So recently I was made aware of this whole [Daniel Tosh thing] where he essentially got into a little spat with a girl about a rape joke that he told. She didn't like it, he shot back, and after joking that the girl be raped by several men, she and her friend left. This soon prompted a flurry of discussion, and a (some might say half-hearted) apology from Tosh.

My Facebook has exploded with my female friends citing their outrage at Tosh, but my first thought was, ""what if he has said murder?"" I mean, rape is a tragic, disgusting thing to happen to anyone, but if he had said ""wouldn't it be funny if this girl got murdered right now"" rather than raped, would there be this big of a response? For some reason, as bad as rape is in my male mind, I can't quite reconcile how this is worse than taking of a life, yet killing, murdering, and all that are sort of second hand in our culture now. What do you think?

Am I crazy to think that maybe the world is over reacting, and how did something like rape and not murder, or torture, or domestic abuse (all of which effect countless people every day) become such a hot button issue?
TL;DR: "," Why is rape more of a ""hot button issue"" than other kinds of violent crimes?

I'm a relatively bright guy and maths usually isn't much of a problem to me and so I didn't have many worries going into the exam, especially considering I'd done a fair amount of revision and not run into too much difficulty.

The exam was in the morning and there was also another exam going on at the same time so in total around a hundred people were in the exam hall, most of whom I'd never spoken to before.

The exam was going fairly well until the last half hour or so where I started to panic slightly as I realised I was unlikely to finish. This was also the point where I realised I forgot to bring water; probably my downfall as it was getting rather sweaty in the hall.

After a few minutes I could no longer concentrate at all so I asked to step outside. By this point I was pretty light-headed and so as soon as I stood up I felt myself falling and then BAM.

TITLE: How can I stop resenting my partner for something that's not their fault?
POST: Here are the facts:

(1.) My partner and I are around the same age and live together, but 
(2.) I've graduated from college and have a full time corporate job, and they are still going to school and working a part-time minimum wage retail job. 
(3.) I make twice what they make, and so I try to cover as much of the shared grocery/household expenses as I can. 
(4.) I work a consistent schedule, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays (with a commute that is one hour either way, so more like 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.), whereas they mostly work mornings and on weekends and go to school at night on weekdays, coming home late around 9 or 10 p.m.

Because of this arrangement, it seems to work out that I have become BOTH the primary breadwinner AND the homemaker, coming home from what feels like a 10 hour day just to make dinner for my partner and then go to bed.

TITLE: Me [22 F] with my boyfriend [23 M]: Did any of you men (or you girl's husbands) think you'd marry later on in life, but did so sooner when you found the right person?
POST: First of all, I am not irrational or dramatic, clingy or anything the like (just a bit of context :) )

My boyfriend and I have known each other for about 2 years, through some classes in university, and what not. We weren't really friends but we started seeing each other more over summer last year, and finally became a couple at the beginning of the year. We're both in our early 20s, as per the title.

We both grew up and still live in the same city in Spain, Spanish families and whatnot and have more or less the same upbringing and families. As you know, Spain is very different from, say, America or more ""open minded"" countries. Overall, it really is a great relationship and I adore the fact that we're both very nondramatic and communicative.

A couple weeks ago we were discussing some issues we had and quite offhandedly we came across the topic of marriage. He mentioned that he doesn't want to be married until his 30s and that we probably won't get married. We both had never really dated before, so we're pretty new to relationships. This guy isn't playing with me, as I've met his family, his friends and overall I know he loves me, respects me and is serious about me.

I'd never really thought seriously of marrying him because of our short relationship, but I also know that this is something that is really important to me and that I always knew I wanted to marry more or less at 25.

**The real thing here is...As all mighty and knowledgeable men: Do you think with time and with actually realizing he's with a good woman, compatible with him and everything, he might think differently about marriage? He has it really clear that he does want a wife and family (ie, he's not at all opposed to marriage), but his idea at the moment is that this will be later on in life. He also has several young married friends and cousins, so it's not something he is ""kept away"" from.

POST: When I was young I remember my parents fighting a lot and being very critical of my behavior in many ways. I sort of turned into a ""good"" polite kid and suppressed my self in many situations.

Since then my parents have divorced, and remarried, and then divorced again. I'm not sure exactly how this has affected me but I think that *maybe* my own feelings were neglected because my parents were very young when they had me (17/18) and so I guess I adapted to not needing anyone. 

Now I feel very tense around my parents and don't feel like I can talk to them. I feel like they are there to judge my actions. I can tell that they really do love me but it's hard for me to reciprocate and things like hugs and saying ""I love you"" feels very strange for me. This distance carries over to all of my friendships as well, and I feel like I have to force myself to smile and make people know that I care about them. 

Often when I am sitting with my friends (who are also somewhat avoidant) I feel the urge to hug them and tell them I love them but it seems impossible. But when I am with people who are more forward with their feelings I get annoyed and close off.

TITLE: How to get over a girl [F19] when you see her every day?
POST: I [M19] have had very strong feelings for a girl for two years now. Our parents are good friends so we grew up together. I never really thought about her as anything other than a friend until I was 17. We were just talking in my bedroom one day (normal thing for us at the time) and we both said that we'd never kissed anyone. We ended up sharing our first kiss that day. Just like that, I was hooked. Eventually I told her I wanted to be together, she said (among other things) that she didn't.

We ended up getting into the same program at university. It's an advanced program in which there are only about 30 people. So I see her every single day. On top of that, our families get together on holidays as well. That is all to say, that she is everywhere I go. We still talk and stuff, but we have drifted apart a bit since university started (which is helping). But she is still in every lecture that I'm in, every lab, every tutorial. I can't transfer to a different uni, because this is the best program there is - I don't want to sacrifice my education for her.

I was dealing with it relatively well, but recently she started dating some guy. He's better than me in every way (taller, more attractive, stronger). They're always kissing. Always. It's ridiculous. It can't be healthy. I've dated two girls since university started. One simply couldn't hold a conversation, so that lasted like 3 dates. The other got back with her ex after 2 months. The hardest part is that every time I close my eyes I see this image of them together and it wont go away. It's been about a year since she rejected me. I honestly don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to kill someone soon.

Anyway, it was the day after his birthday, and we had gotten him a new iPad. We came over to help him set it up.

Then, I went back outside to resume the super dumb time-killing game. What I didn't know, though, was that my grandpa had closed the door in the man time. I took a running start, jumped, and slammed against the glass door. It didn't break, but my thumb hurt like hell. Later that day, we were supposed to visit my grandparents on my mom's side, and stay for a few days. On our way, my thumb started hurting so bad with every movement that I couldn't even move it anymore. We decided to go to the hospital with my grandpa on my mom's side, after he picked us up. To make a long story short, we went to the hospital, and they diagnosed it as broken. I had to wear a full wrist cast for a while after that. I also play the piano, so you can imagine the struggle.

POST: I'm a college student (20F) that's been with her 20M boyfriend for nearly two years.  He's absolutely perfect--smart, funny, caring, compassionate, etc.  I, unfortunately, have little to offer him.  I'm not attractive, I'm not very intelligent, we have none of the same hobbies or interests.  Yet he loves me and wants to be with me indefinitely, and I'm certain I want to marry this man.

My question is this: if we were to break up, I'm afraid of being seen as damaged goods by every other man.  We haven't had sex for two reasons--I'm terrified of the pain and I don't want to risk pregnancy even though I have several BC methods at my disposal.  I understand that sex is necessary to keep a man around long-term, and I know he doesn't want to hurt me.  But right now I'm just sort of waiting it out and buying as much time as possible.  

Please help?  I want to make him happy but I'm scared of being thought of as a slut by other men in the future (if this relationship doesn't work out) and I'm also afraid of getting hurt and being used.

Some other information: I'm a virgin, so is he.  No sexual abuse history.  No prior relationship experience on either side.  He has never once pressured me into sex--he's willing to wait as long as I need, which makes me feel worse because I don't have much to offer him as a person.

POST: I'm a college student (20F) that's been with her 20M boyfriend for nearly two years.  He's absolutely perfect--smart, funny, caring, compassionate, etc.  I, unfortunately, have little to offer him.  I'm not attractive, I'm not very intelligent, we have none of the same hobbies or interests.  Yet he loves me and wants to be with me indefinitely, and I'm certain I want to marry this man.

My question is this: if we were to break up, I'm afraid of being seen as damaged goods by every other man.  We haven't had sex for two reasons--I'm terrified of the pain and I don't want to risk pregnancy even though I have several BC methods at my disposal.  I understand that sex is necessary to keep a man around long-term, and I know he doesn't want to hurt me.  But right now I'm just sort of waiting it out and buying as much time as possible.  

Please help?  I want to make him happy but I'm scared of being thought of as a slut by other men in the future (if this relationship doesn't work out) and I'm also afraid of getting hurt and being used.

Some other information: I'm a virgin, so is he.  No sexual abuse history.  No prior relationship experience on either side.  He has never once pressured me into sex--he's willing to wait as long as I need, which makes me feel worse because I don't have much to offer him as a person.

TITLE: 2yrs. with sweet SO (21/M) but he's starting to bore me (20/F)
POST: my boyfriend and i have been dating for two years now, since my freshman year of college. we knew each other in high school but things didn't heat up until after graduation. this is my longest relationship to-date and he is an amazing guy (sweet, respectful, supportive) but i'm starting to get bored. 

not just bored with the relationship (yes, we do the same thing every time we hang out) but i'm worried that i'm bored with him. he has stopped pursuing an education since graduating high school (i realize that college/institutional learning isn't for everyone, but i think reading and learning about things you are passionate about is important for mental health & happiness). he is a hard worker (two jobs) and says all the right things when i talk about the future, but i can't help but feel like he's just telling me what i want to hear. 

all of his friends do pretty much the same thing (work a few jobs, get high after work and game until morning) and i worry that nothing will change despite what he tells me. we don't have many common interests (the most significant being our relationship) but he adores me and assures me that he would never leave me. i don't want to break his heart, especially if i'm at all unsure -- i tend to discount emotions and worry that i'm being a heartless bitch.  

any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.

TITLE: [21M] It's been 3 weeks, having troubles getting over her [23F].
POST: *Same breakup as the posts [here (10 days in)] and [here (5 days in)](

It's been three weeks. Well, more precisely, 23 days. In that time I've deleted her on facebook (though saving the over 44000-word conversation we had as some kind of archive deep in my computer), deleted her number, and generally kept no contact other than very formally (and coldly) wishing her a happy birthday last week. 

I've started both an OKCupid and a Tinder, and I've been having conversations with girls on both, most of which have been pleasant experiences. I haven't gone on any dates, but this girl I've been texting from OKC seems interested and I could go for some companionship.  

I'm still hurting. My life still has its ups and downs, and it's getting really hard to see the good parts of being single. At my absolute lowest, though I don't act on it, I very much feel that I want her back (even though reading through  my past posts will have you convinced it's a bad idea). However, I acknowledge that this is most likely me missing the *companionship* instead of just missing her.

Fuck being single. No really, FUCK being single. Call me a serial monogamist, but I ENJOY having someone around to call my own. Someone to hang out with constantly, someone I can randomly text about how their day is going. My friends all stick to the sage advice of ""it's better to be single than in a shitty relationship"", but honestly I hate sleeping alone. I hate not having someone to cuddle with. Dreaming of her then waking up alone in the bed we shared is NOT a pleasant way to start the day.

I'm not really sure what my question is. I think I just want to know how long my life is going to be shitty like this, and how long it'll be before I know that my future relationships aren't rebounds.

POST: Throwaway because I don't want work to find me. Names have all been changed for safety.

We've worked together less than 6 months. Tom has been here shortest, for about 2 months and has been a nuance the entire time.

My coworker, Tom (23m), has the tendency to make me uncomfortable. He has made sexist comments before, in front of our supervisor. Well, today he was asking the guys in my area for advice.

He was asking our supervisor, Bill (30s? M), and coworker, Damian (late 20s? M) for advice about cheating on his girlfriend. She is his second baby momma. 

I'm pretty sure Bill and Damian were telling Tom not to cheat towards the end, but at first they seemed to be trying to help him. I think Bill was trying to get him to stop talking about it.

It made me extremely uncomfortable. Damian, Tom, and I work for a temp agency. I am considering going to our boss through the agency, as she is also hr for us. But I'm worried about going to her because I think that'll give her reason to fire me. 

This is a workplace, not a hangout. These are not your friends. It is so unprofessional to talk about these things at work.

POST: My very new official girlfriend is a gamer (im also a gamer, btw), and im having trouble ""adapting"" to this new lifestyle. My ex-gf's have never played videogames seriously like my current gf does, so there's a lot of things i really struggle with, but on new years eve something strange happened. 

We were together at this party and everyone was having fun and getting drunk. After the fireworks, we were all pretty wasted and me and my GF where not hanging out together. I was talking to some people, and she was talking to some other people. Not a big deal, obviously. But after a while, i started looking for her and then i find her down in the basement playing League of Legends on the hosts computer with a couple of guys looking at her playing. I kinda freaked out a little bit, but didnt show anyone that i did because i didnt want to make a scene. So i just left the house with a friend for a little bit to calm myself down.

Now, my question is: Was i wrong in freaking out about this? The people at the party were all gamers too, and like i said, she was not down there alone. She was talking to those who sat there while she was playing etc... But I still cant shake the feeling that she shouldnt have done it. To me, this would've never been an option because i was at someone's party :s  I just need some opinions here, because i dont know what to do...! 

Sidenote: I have talked to her about it, and we both apologized for what happened and put it in the past. But i cant stop thinking about it, and i need help :o

She in her past relationship was very controlled by her ex and rarely spent time with her friends ever.

Her friends also are all single though so I can see why they would want to go to these gatherings despite my girlfriends reinsurance that they just love dancing / going out.

I'm just wondering if I'm being insecure and just move past the social setting and understand shes a very faithful person who would never cheat or am I justified in being uncomfortable with this all and what should I do?

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 and a half years, since our freshman year of college. We are each other's first love and he is everything that I want in a partner: smart, caring, funny, respectful and handsome. We're going into our senior year  and have started discussing the future. 

We've both said that we'd like to stick together and continue dating in the long term. My dream has always been to get a PhD in political science, so I would like to either 1) spend a year or two abroad getting fluent in a foreign language or 2) get a masters degree and take language classes on the side. His dream is to get a year-long internship in our local city government and then apply to law school. Luckily our college gives graduates access to lots of great opportunities so I'm confident that we can find things that are close by and fulfil some, if not all, of our individual goals. 

My worry is that my boyfriend seems unwilling/ unable to plan for his future. He doesn't seem to have made any steps towards securing his goals, or figuring out what he will do if they don't work out. I hate pressuring people, and I understand that at this age it's completely normal not to know what you want to do. But the reality is that if we don't start figuring out at least a general outline ( such as a list of possible locations/schools) it's likely that we'll end up very far away from each other with no end point in sight. I really don't want to do long distance. 

I've tried to help out. I asked around my older friends and managed to get him a set of LSAT prep books and account details for a well-reviewed online prep course. I also researched some fellowships that would provide financial support for his internship. So far he hasn't really followed up on any of these, although he did tell me that the books looked good. Am I being unreasonable in my expectations?  Should I take this as a sign that our relationship is not a priority to him and back off or should I try to prod him a little more?

My worry is that my boyfriend seems unwilling/ unable to plan for his future. He doesn't seem to have made any steps towards securing his goals, or figuring out what he will do if they don't work out. I hate pressuring people, and I understand that at this age it's completely normal not to know what you want to do. But the reality is that if we don't start figuring out at least a general outline ( such as a list of possible locations/schools) it's likely that we'll end up very far away from each other with no end point in sight. I really don't want to do long distance. 

I've tried to help out. I asked around my older friends and managed to get him a set of LSAT prep books and account details for a well-reviewed online prep course. I also researched some fellowships that would provide financial support for his internship. So far he hasn't really followed up on any of these, although he did tell me that the books looked good. Am I being unreasonable in my expectations?  Should I take this as a sign that our relationship is not a priority to him and back off or should I try to prod him a little more?

TITLE: I [m/29] have been dating girl [f/23] for a couple of months. Things have been going great but I was just laid off and am likely moving in 2 weeks.
POST: I [m/29] met this girl a little over a year ago [f/23] and we dated briefly back then but lost touch for whatever reason. We ran in to each other a couple of months ago and started dating again. Things have been going great and I am really starting to like her but just two weeks ago I lost my job. I have a great opportunity a good distance away (17 hour drive, for reference) with limited prospects in the current city.

I've done long distance before and I have no problem doing it again. I'm not sure how she feels about that though and I'm not sure how I should bring it up. I guess since we are so new in to this I'm not sure if it would be foolish to think that a long distance relationship is feasible. I am leaving for the city in a couple of days to go interview but will be back soon after that. I have been honest with her about all this but deep down I have a strong feeling that I will be moving. Any advice on how to handle this situation would be appreciated. Thanks.

POST: So, before we really start, I'm a 20 year old male. I'm certain of my attraction to women, long list of reasons. Anyways;

For the past 3 years, after my first real relationship (nearly a year long, end of grade 12 kind of deal) I have had literally no sex drive. Both girls I've been with (first was six months, second was a year and a couple) have left me because of my lack of sex drive. More recently even setting herself (18f) up with another guy before leaving me, making me feel even more damaged in the process. 

I've tried bringing girls back to my apartment (I live with 2 roommates) to see if I could jumpstart my sexual desire, but I lose interest literally in the middle of sex and pretend to finish in order to get to stop. I feel awful afterwards, but I'll do this or get intoxicated every other night. It's either that or fight off urges to hurt myself. I'm extremely lost.

I've lost all of my close friends because of the girl who left me anyways (she was literally my best friend; figured we were in it for the long haul etc etc) and I haven't gotten along with my family in years. Now because of the multiple stunts my ex pulled and my lack of relationship with my family, I have no one to ask. So here it is Reddit; how do I fix this?

POST: I've been dating Andy for 6 months. After we started dating, I found out he had gone out with a friend of mine with the same name a couple weeks before but she didn't feel a spark. We're close, but no one had an issue with it. Let's say I'm Ally 1, she's Ally 2.

About a month in, I started seeing Andy everyday and slept with him. We started opening up, and he told me very personal things that he allegedly has told no one else. We went exclusive and he stopped dating other girls. He wanted to wait for deep feelings for labels; 3 months in, he asked. I pointed out signs of depression and pushed him to get help, and he thanked me: ""I don't think anyone has cared about me so much, except my mom"". 

He invited me to his hometown, introduced me to all of his friends, and has made plans for way down the road. When I was considering moving an hour away, he asked me not to. Months in, he confessed he had been a virgin before me, and had lied from embarrassment. I didn't think it was a big deal. 

Yesterday, I was - with his permission - using his phone and searched my name. I came up with texts to his best friend from before we were exclusive. I can post the convo, but here's some quotes:

> ""God damn I can't stop thinking about Ally 2. [...] last night, I imagined Ally 1 was Ally 2 during sex, so sketch. I should probably break up with her.""

> ""I have zero feelings for her. Hardcore leading her on. [...] I act like I like her too, but I don't.""

TITLE: Am I ridiculous, or am I in a one-sided relationship?
POST: Hello all.

Quick, simple question. I just want to know if I ask too much and my expectations are too high.

I [22F] have been dating Fin[22M] for one year, and I feel as though compromising with him is impossible. I end up just letting him have his way and he views the time spent debating as a ""compromise."" 

Today, for example, I work Saturday mornings so usually I stay in at my place while he goes out on Fridays. However, I had a pretty stressful day and asked him if he'd catch a movie with me to make me feel better. He told me that he had wanted to go out so no. I had a back up plan, but the fact that he wouldn't even entertain the idea on my behalf is unsettling. We discussed it, I agreed I'd go with back up plan, and he thought this was a compromise.

Likewise, sex has become an issue. We both have high sex drives, but he likes to have sex before he goes to bed. However, due to work schedules he goes to bed way after me, therefore he wakes me up for sex. I try to explain its not that I don't want it, it's that I can't possibly be into it if I'm asleep. I try to have sex before I go to sleep, but usually this involved dragging him away from his friends, which us a Herculean task. I he refuses and just tries to quickly squeeze in sex until JUST before I get to sleep. Literally, a few minute venture.

Worst of all, I can't discuss this with him without him being angry. I'm not sure how to bring it up properly in order to have a constructive conversation instead of a destructive conflict. Am I being too unforgiving? Or should I discuss? If I can have some pointers on how to properly address this, that would be ideal. Thanks!

TITLE: Me [25 F] with my partner [25 M] cheated in last relationship and he still communicates with that !!!!!!.
POST: Before me and my current boyfriend started dating we were -just friends- and he was in a different relationship. After a month or so of their break up we got together. Apparently their relationship started falling apart like 2 years ago because she cheated on him and to get back at her he had sex with one of his good friends. His ex with good reason told him to stop talking to her and he did. Until we got together. I've been telling him how much it bothers me and around december 30th she just.... randomly blocked him, and unblocked him about a month ago now. My BF did NOT tell me about this nor is he curious why she would block him in the first place. He's told me it was an honest mistake that he did not tell me they were in communication again and I just.... I don't know how to be direct enough with him. It's pushing me away and I know he's sick of hearing about it, but I have no reason to believe something weird isn't going on, but I truly want to hear why it shouldn't make me uncomfortable. How do I approach this?

TITLE: My mother's [39/F] boyfriend [28/M] broke up with her 1 month before her baby is due and he doesn't want to leave the house
POST: My mom was in a relationship with a young guy she met while she was running a bar. She has always been kinda ""new age friendly"", and this guy is a reiki master, does biomagnetism, the whole package, so she fell hard for him. They were pretty happy together, and 4 months into the relationship they decided to have a baby.
 

It was all pretty cool, he was always talking how now we were a family, that it was gonna be great to have a baby, yadda yadda yadda. Until last week, when, out of nowhere, he told her that he didn't loved her anymore and that he had a new girl. We were pretty shocked, and while my mom suspected the girl had a thing for him (they are co-workers, he's a teacher at a local highschool, and she saw them together a couple times while going to pick him up), she never thought he also had a thing for her. 

After the initial shock, we were expecting him to move out, but he had a talk with my mother and says it's best for the baby that he sticks around, in case he's needed for a run to the hospital (she has been passing out at least twice a month), and now my mother is confused, letting him stay for a couple days.

So here we are, the ""I can get you to the hospital"" thing is bullshit since she has plenty of friends and family to spend this month with, starting with me, but when I point this out to her she starts avoiding the subject, since she still loves him and hopes she can make him come back to her. So I would love to hear some objective opinions on the subject, because I think it's awful for her and the baby to be under this kind of pressure with the a--hole in the house, but who knows, I'm biased by the amount of hate I feel right now.

My relationship history is complicated, but she knows all about it and whenever we flirt she ends up playfully punching me. But what does that mean? I don't know if she feels hurt 'cause I always poke fun or should I stop poking fun and be nicer in this regard. We'll be seeing each other every day this week studying for an exam this Friday, then she's off on a trip for a while until January. I think she might be into me and I think I might be into her. Should I make a move? If so, should I wait until after the exam or until she comes back from her trip, or should I tell her right now. Or should I wait until something else entirely? Please help.

TITLE: Me [29] and my GF [27] of 5 months can't decide whether to break up or not.
POST: First off, sorry for the ambiguity in the title. I feel a bit silly even posting this but I haven't been able to figure it out on my own.

I've known her since college. We dated for about a year back then and had an amicable breakup which actually allowed us to stay very close friends for another decade (holy...). I always loved her as a friend and throughout the years we were still somewhat romantically involved when we were both single. Without too much detail, I know that I love this woman more than anyone else in my life and trust her with everything.

The problem is that she's moving to California for various reasons, and she had been planning to before we started dating again. It's what she thinks will make her happier and I would never think of pursuading her otherwise. She moves in about 4 months, but has been throwing out the idea of us breaking off our romantic relations now in order to make it easier on us once she moves.

I, however, feel like we should be enjoying the time that we have left together and ""cross that bridge when we come to it"" as I always tell her. She still loves me and wants to be with me (from what she says) but can't stop thinking about what it will be like not having me while in California, and that she should get used to not having me while she is still here in NYC.

Notes
* Neither of us wants to do long distance
* I have a job here that I do not want to leave

I would appreciate literally any insight you all have, can't really think of a specific question but if I had to...who's right?

I'll be happy to fill in any details you are curious about.

When we first met I was 127-130 pounds and after getting to college and living on my own I am 152 pounds and I'm 5'6 (Serious weight gain, i know) My bf is in really good shape and works out often. I work out around 3-4 times a week but don't eat healthy. I am trying to lose weight but I'm not sure I will be able to get back to my old weight. This is what brings me to my problem. 

He tends to say mean things about how I look, what I eat, what I weigh. I know he hasn't been happy about how I look for a while, but I thought he was still attracted to me and he just wishes I looked better. Lately I started paying attention to our sex life and more details and I realized that 9 out of 10 I initiated sex and that if I don't, we wouldn't have sex. He also never tells me I look good, or gives me compliment. Lately, the only compliments I get are 'I like your hair' or something of that sort. He also doesn't look at me when I'm changing EVER or look at me with desire. I sent him sexy pictures and he responds saying 'your hair looks amazing'. I know he loves me and he is good to me, but being with someone that is not attracted to me affects my self steem a lot and if I don't lose the weight, he will never be attracted to me. I don't know what to do at this point because I'm worried that if I gain weight later in the relationsip, the same thing will happen again. I feel really bad because I am very attracted to him and love him dearly. I just wish he would feel the same way about me.

TITLE: I[28m] never hear from the girl [29f] ive been dating outside of our great times together. Can anyone relate?
POST: We're not officially anything but we are exclusive, she's definitely an independent, career driven type. We've been dating only a couple months, and contact was a lot heavier at first, texting good morning/night n stuff in between, funny pics or whatever. We see each other about once or twice a week and always seem to have a great time together, great intimacy, great conversation.

But I dont hear anything from her in between, maybe one text, unless I initiate it. I'll text sometimes or call, but it seems like the week could easily go by without any word from her. I'm more of a text daily type (nothing excessive, but at least 1 text), but feel odd having it be one sided, so I've pulled back a bit with it. Part of me thinks regardless of what type of person you are, if you're actually interested in someone you will not be able to help yourself but to reach out to them. I could easily send a random goofy text and get no response.

I've even brought it up more recently asking if its a sign her interest is waning and she said it's just her settling into her normal communication style and doesnt want to date anyone else. When we're together she is all about me, my friends, making me feel great. When we part I always feel great about it, but after a few days go by without hearing from her, without fail, it again feels odd that she's not reaching out to me ever. This concern is then taken away when I see her again and once again we have a great time.

I conceded that I won't be able to see her in Mexico - its a girls trip. The other girls don't want me there and thats perfectly fine. I'm now staying with a friend in the city. 

So now in Vegas - I've seen packages that include rooms that sleep 4 with shuttles included for a good price. So there are 4 of us, so I suggested 'lets get one of these deals'

My ex's response was 'I'll ask the girls'

The girls say 'He can stay in the same hotel, but different room'

The girl's reasoning is they think that emotions between me and my ex will ruin their trip. I called my ex this morning and both came to the conclusion that we don't know whether it could be amazing, or terrible - whether one of us will get upset if the other wants to hook up with someone else, essentially

But the crux of my argument - her friends want 'single ex'. I believe that with them living with her for the past 6 months+, they can give me 4 nights, especially since I'm making that concession that is me bowing out of seeing my ex in Mexico.

Does reddit think I'm expecting too much? I see maturity being a massive factor in dictating how this experience will go.

POST: basically, I think going to a strip club in a monogamous relationship is cheating. This is for my relationships, I'm not prescribing anything to yours.

I told him within the first month or so of dating that I thought this, and I've repeated it. He has agreed to it. We're two years in now. 

Now, he's the best man for a wedding. He hasn't even discussed this with me yet, but there will be a bachelor party. I know not all involve strippers, but this one will. 

I'm looking to prepare myself for this upcoming conversation. This man is his childhood best friend. Can I really say no to him partaking in his bachelor party? That seems unfair. But at the same, I know it'll kill me to know some naked woman is grinding on my guy.

POST: I did a search on the topic but was unable to find anything relevant, so here goes.

We'll soon be going on our first date. Nothing fancy, I'll buy her coffee and we'll sit down and talk to get to know each other.

I've been in one longterm relationship before, but my experiences with dating is almost at a zero. Therefore I'm in desperate need for advice on where we should go for our second date, and when I should make a move on her.

I'm pretty sure it should just stay with the smiling and hugging at the first date, but should I try to hold her hand on the second or even try to kiss her? I know it all depend on the mood, set and setting etc., but some of my friends told me not to wait too long to make the first move, otherwise I could lose her interest.

Now I might have an advantage. When we randomly met in public not so long ago, we got to talk about a dessert I was preparing for my family. She told me that I should make it for her someday, and I agreed to.

So if I tell her after our first date that I think we should meet again, she might propose the idea of coming over to my place so I could make the dessert for her. If so, that would be our second date.

And I have some kind of feeling that I should definitely make a move on her, if we are at my place. But I'm in no personal need to do so, I'm just fine by taking it slow. It's just that I really know jack shit about dating and reading girls to be honest with you.

TITLE: I always feel rejected when my boyfriend isn't in the mood for sex - I don't want to feel that way, any ideas?
POST: I'm 21, female, in a relationship with a boy (23). We've been together for nearly a year now. We both go to college and live together for two month.

My problem is that I have serious trouble asking for what I want/need or even talking about my wishes. Even more serious I can't handle beeing rejected (which in turn makes it harder to ask for something because I'm afraid of my own reaction which I cannot controll).
Whenever I get myself to ask for something like cuddeling or having sex I feel really disapointed if he is not in the mood right now. I can't help myself but start crying, which I do not want. Naturally he is unhappy with the situation, too. He is always very nice, he doesn't let himself being talked into anything and I'm very gratefull for it, since I would hate myself if my behaviour would blackmail him.
I try to talk myself into a state of mind where it would be ok if he says no, I try to simulate my reaction in case of rejection before I ask for something. I even tried beeing pessimistic and telling myself that I wouldn't get what I want for. But it all doesn't help. 

I don't even know why I feel that way, it's not like he always says no to my suggestions. Still I feel very hurt and rejected in those situations.

The best I've ever managed was a situation where I asked for sex and he didn't felt that way. He hugged me and I had tears in my eyes and was talking about how shitty it is that I always start crying but catched myself quite fast and we played some game together.
However lately it is rather getting worse. 

In generall we've talked about that topic over and over again, but I have no idea how to fix my reaction. I don't want to feel that way. If he asks for somethink I can always say yes or no and for him it's quite esay to take a no. I would like it to be the same for me.

POST: I realize this question is personal and can change but I just want to get a rough idea on what people think.

I'm on reddit regularly and see a lot of posts on how people get bored of their partners and start wishing they experienced other sexual experiences if they are each others first or if they've had limited experience. this leads to them cheating or going on breaks where they eventually separate

Ive been with my boyfriend for a few years now and we're planing on settling down, we were both virgins and we were both old to be virgins ( he was 25 and I was 23 ). I'm beginning to fear that he might eventually feel bored of our sex life and have these desires to be with other women. I mean he didn't have any experience and nor did I so what if one day he decides hed like to be with someone who is more experienced? or that hed like the thrill of being with other women etc.

Part of me feels like a crazy lunatic because my bf hasn't expressed anything to hint that hes feeling this way if anything hes more interested in sex then ever but nonetheless reading all these posts about people and relationships having an expiry date before they get bored of each other is really playing with my mind

Is there anyone out there who have only ever had a single partner and have been okay with it ? is it a normal process to feel like you'll want to have sex with other people after a certain period but feel trapped ? is it possible that this won't happen or is that a slim in comparison ?

POST: This summer, the summer between our junior and senior years of college my boyfriend is working at a pretty large tech company as an intern and I am stuck in our college town making a shitty hourly rate at a job that isn't doing much for my career. 

As much as I love him its getting to the point where i don't even want to talk to him anymore because I can't muster the energy to be excited and proud of his relationship anymore because I am so insanely and stupidly jealous.

POST: I (M 18) very recently started dating a girl ( f 17) and we are very open with each other, share several common interests, and overall really enjoy each others company.

 Lately we've been up all hours of the night on Skype talking about practically everything under the sun. The other night while we were talking she told me some of the horror stories about how her sick bastard of an adopted father sexually abused her. From what she told me he has been in prison for the last 3 years and her adopted mother has since divorced him. She has been, and still is in counseling from these traumatic experiences.

Here's where things get really bad. I guess he's going to be released from prison and she is almost certain that he is going to try and find them and is terrified.

TITLE: [31/m] needs help with LTR that's achieved mediocrity
POST: I've been with my girlfriend for 8 years. Yes, girlfriend, 8 years. We've had our ups and downs, no need for a lot of background (unless requested, I guess). She's wanted to get married, to have kids, etc for a long while. I can't see myself, right now, doing any of these things.

I think my resistance comes from a place of selfishness, hence my post here. I love her, I respect her, I don't want to lose her, but we're different enough that I think the relationship would just coast at idle for the rest of our lives, if we were to spend them together. I want someone who's more like me, who's more into the things I'm into without having to bore/force them on them. I want to be legitimately interested in THEIR things. While I'm not likely to find the female version of me (and I sincerely hope to never meet that person, oi), I want them to be independent enough so that when it comes to things we're not mutually keen on, we're perfectly capable of enjoying our own things without having to drag one another though stuff we're not going to enjoy.

I really do care for this person, and my biased thought is: we're not right enough for one another, and it would be better for both of us to find more compatible people. The problem I'm having is twofold: Having met real life people that I just click with better, I feel like maybe I'm experiencing a ""grass is greener"" moment. Given the massive number of people on the earth, there will almost always be someone that will be a better match, so where do you stop? The other side of this coin is that I don't want to hurt her, and there will definitely be a lot of hurt involved.

So what do I do? Do I stay in an acceptable-yet-fairly-mediocre relationship, or break out of this rut and try for something greater and more passionate?

TITLE: Am I doing it all wrong?
POST: Welp, I really can't complain about anything in my life. I go to a good college where I have a lot of fun. I was raised in a stable household. My parents never really restricted me from doing anything, but aside from regular neighborhood shennanigans, I never really got into any serious trouble. I LOVE technology and all this crazy stuff in our generation, but whenever I read about or watch something having to do with anything up through the 1970s, I can't help but think that I would enjoy myself more fully if I were living more simply. I'm really not trying to sound like a hippy or anything here but I figured this would be the best place to find some people that would seriously discuss this sort of thing with me. I always find myself wishing I was raised in my parents era, where everyone was allowed to do much more and not worry about getting in trouble, relationships were formed in person (i know, a bit ironic that I am on reddit), people would make their own fun, and of course, the music. I mean, I know I am kinda ranting now, but I hope at least one person makes it this far without dismissing their thoughts. Aside from this whole generation thing, I always wonder about my life choices. As I stated I go to college, and I like to believe that this is because it interests me and I think it will help me make a difference, but almost daily, I question myself. Should I just be camping and exploring out on the road? Should I go try to make a living as a snowboard instructor so I can live on a mountain and do what I love daily? Should I have not gone to college to pursue what I love the most, playing music? I feel like I took the ""safe"" route. I don't plan on dropping out, I have a lot of fun and am extremely fortunate to be able to go to my college, but I just wanted to see if there was anyone out there that felt similar/has advice/had ANYTHING to say out there. Am I doing it all wrong?

TITLE: Reddit, how do I become a better biochemist/scientist??
POST: For the past 2 year of my life, I have been volunteering as a researcher in my school. I have put in a substantial amount of time learning and mastering protocols practiced in the field of biochemistry and have been mentored by what I honestly believe to be some of the world's best grad students/post docs/professors. I am seriously a hardworker and I try my best to not be lazy when it comes to science.

However, here lies my problem: A couple of days ago, one of my mentors was helping me trouble shoot an experiment, and in the process sort of gave me a very stern talk about how I needed to write in my lab notebook more, and how I needed to be more present in the lab (not as in my attendance, but as in my mind needed to be there while I was doing my work). The point of the talk was that I needed to be able to stand up on my own two feet and stop asking so many redundant questions that have been answered over a million times. 

I agreed with what my mentor said and really, as much as I hated to admit it, my scientific method definitely needed improvement if I ever wanted to become a mature scientist. I have started to note down everything in my lab notebook, and am starting to be more attentive in lab. So, to gain more insight on the scientific method I am here, writing to you. Reddit, how do you approach science??? What are somethings you do to try and be more organized??? How have you perfected your laboratory skills?

POST: Being so strongly attracted to someone rarely happens to me. The simple fact that I am posting here is baffling.

It wouldn't be such a problem, if I didn't have to see her every single day. She's part of my university course and I'll most definitely be seeing more of her the next 3 years.

We used to talk a lot during / after lectures or at least until I found out she had a boyfriend. I've been trying to distance myself from her as I'm not okay with just being friends.

I thought if I kept myself occupied I'd get over it quickly, but seeing her is making it so very difficult.

I went clubbing last night with my friends and it was all going great. But then I saw her with her boyfriend and it crushed me on the inside and I just felt like getting out, so I went home.

I have plenty of hobbies that keep me busy, but it doesn't help.

TITLE: Help! I like this girl but don't know if she likes me/don't know what to do about it.
POST: Before posting ""ask her out,"" please read the post specifically because it's a little more complicated I think.

So here's the deal. Basically, I like this girl. We're both 16 and in high school. However, I only share one class with her and it isn't really possible to talk to her in it. So we have limited conversation randomly.

Here's the way the confusing part comes in. Sometimes we make quite a bit of eye contact in hallways and stuff and sometimes we don't. However, now I'm getting sick of it. The more I think about it, the more reasons I come up with to think that she doesn't like me. Also, she rarely initiates anything like texting or conversations when we can talk. She seems shy so I don't know if it's that or that she doesn't have any interest in me.

So at this point you're probably thinking, why don't you end the pain and ask her out already?
First of all, I don't even really know what that means. I don't know if asking someone out means asking them to be your girlfriend/boyfriend or if it means asking someone on a date. If it's the first, I want to get to know her more first. If it's the second, I have never seen anyone in our school (it's small) ask someone on a date. So I guess that's weird in High School?

Also, with eye contact and hallways, I'm starting to worry that if she doesn't like me, she probably thinks I'm creepy since I look at her a lot more in hallways. Maybe girls are generally sneakier about it? (At this point I'm trying to be obvious so maybe she'll initiate something or give me a sign that she likes me too.)

So in my dream, the world was being slowly taken over by wild dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were running around eating people and pretty much causing a huge panic; and the only two people who could stop them were myself, and Adolf Hitler. Hitler and myself made our way to a gun store where we picked up assault rifles, sub machine guns, pistols, and I remembering grabbing what looked to be a M1 Garand. We were able to use Hitlers influence to get the guns for free because, hey, he is the fucking Fuhrer. After grabbing the guns we somehow were able to lasso two triceratops and after magically obtaining saddles for them, Hitler and myself proceeded to ride the triceratops around town while shooting the other dinosaurs that were eating people. After riding around town shooting dinosaurs, we came to this tall tower which kind of looked like the leaning tower of Pisa, but it was vertical with no lean to it. Hitler and myself climbed the tower while being chased by dinosaurs. When Hitler and myself reached the top of the tower, we proceed to snipe dinosaurs from the top of the tower. After firing hundreds of rounds and killing hundreds of dinosaurs, I woke up.

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my FWB [24 F] 3 months-sh, need some outside insight into behavior
POST: So I guess most of the pertinent 'relationship' details are in the title. She has been my friend since freshman year of college. I think I'm just going to jump into the question and then add details via edits or comments based on what people think they need.

She recently asked to take a day off work since she is house sitting for a week which I am more than happy to do. But she also asked me to go on her family's vacation with her which seems very anti-FWBish. 

So I think she's wanting more, and while I'm somewhere in the middle of what I want, I at least want to talk about with her to make sure we're on the same page before something awkward happens on her family vacation.

I had plans last night to meet her for some drinks which was a perfect opportunity to bring this up. So she texted me around the arranged time and I texted her back and then didn't hear anything for two-ish hours. When I heard from her again, she apologized and said that her phone has been having service problems with sending and receiving texts all day. Texting since then has spotty, but not negative or overall different.  

This seems fishy in today's world, but it's also a pretty a paper-thin excuse so I'm inclined to believe it. Plus, our plans RE: house sitting and vacation are still on. 

Should I continue as planned? I think I'm just looking for general insights and opinions.

Coupled with all the stress/anxiety/depression that typically follows college-to-real world transition, I have been getting extremely jealous of her adventures and experiences. One of the purposes of a relationship is to create and share memories together, so knowing that she's making some of the best memories of her life without me cuts DEEP, to say the least. She'll text me about all of the wonderful adventures she had that day and the places she went/things she saw; while I try my very best to act excited and happy for her, I'll be FULL of jealousy, bitterness and even anger. Angry that she decided to go on this adventure without me because in my mind I would have never done the same (which is totally not true because I was abroad 2 years ago). I know that I'm being selfish and bitter, but honestly cannot control it.
It's getting to a point where the jealousy is overshadowing my excitement for her to get home. I'm finding that I am extremely annoyed with her when we talk, am losing interest in talking to her but feel obligated to because I know you need that comfort when you're abroad, and am losing excitement for her to come home because I know alllll she will do is talk about her adventures and experiences, while all I will do is remind myself that she did all of this without me.

TITLE: Me [24M] and my friend [24F] of 5 months, her Hodgkin's is Stage II and unresponsive to treatments. Unsure how to help and guilty about not showing support recently.
POST: A while ago I posted on how I befriended someone with cancer. At the time I thought their cancer was pretty easily treatable, but as time went on it turned out they're one of the rare cases where the treatments aren't working for her. 

I've gotten busy with school and we'd get dinner and hang out to do painting, but these days I haven't been able to offer support. I check in with her now boyfriend and friends to see how she's doing and she seems like a pretty big mess due to the grim updates she's been getting on her results. Honestly, I know that it'll reach palliative care and she'll probably pass away within the year. I text her every now and then to offer support and I know she likes having any sort of company even if it's a stranger in a coffee shop. I just don't have that much time anymore to go out of my way to hang out.

I have a major exam, have to remediate a class in a couple weeks and I've been dealing with internal issues such as depression pretty badly for the past few months. I see her posting on facebook along with others mentioning how she has to get checked into urgent care and I feel bad that I'm just sitting in a library studying or at home.

TITLE: Update: I [20M] ended it with my girlfriend [21F] last night.
POST: [Previous Post] (  

So last night I told her I didn't want to keep trying to make this work because ultimately, I didn't think I'd be able to get over what she did. When I told her she said she doesn't see any more reason to live and just walked out of my apartment, didn't take her phone, keys, nothing. I got worried and called 911. She's now in the hospital pending a psych evaluation for possible depression. 

I was there with her last night for support but when they said I had to leave she told me to ""have a nice life,"" and I left the hospital. She refused to let her parents know she's in the hospital and told me not to tell anyone, but I told her best friend. I needed to tell someone because I didn't want to be the only person who knew, especially since I am no longer willing to be romantically involved with her. She currently isn't allowed to have visitors.  

 Should I visit? Should I try to keep contact with her? I would just like to know she's ok and that she'll be able to move on with her life.

TITLE: I [23f] feel really alone even when my husband [22] is around
POST: We've been married for a year next month, and have had some struggles for the past couple of months. 
Mostly, anymore, I feel like he is absolutely addicted to his phone. He uses it a lot for as a means of communication with coworkers and work email, he also uses it a lot at work in his downtime. For him, his phone is a means of distraction and decompression after a long day. 
Anymore though, it's hard to get him off of it. Every time he picks it up I can't help but get frustrated. He hardly texts me while he's at work anymore, while I know he gets on it, uses social media, talks to others. 
I try to be accepting of the fact that it, and sometimes video games are things he needs to relax sometimes. But it's gotten to the point where I feel like he hardly pays me any attention, and is more enveloped in his phone/ online worlds. It's frustrating for me. I love him, but I feel so alone, even when he's home. 

We are both sort of the anti-social type. He just isn't that into it, and I am cripplingly shy. I work, but wouldn't ever meet up with or hang out with anyone from there outside of work. I barely even talk to anyone there anyway, there are a lot of differences. 

We don't really go out much either, a date night every paycheck typically. He's on his phone for a good chunk of it though. And the last time, it was difficult to even find a topic of conversation. It's hard to even get him to go out and go grocery shopping with me. I don't drive myself, so going out is somewhat difficult. 

I've suggested we do something like join groups on Meet Up. We've skimmed the local groups, but never made an account or tried to go to anything.

I know he's really stressed at work right now, and has been for a couple of months. He's got a lot going on. But, it's difficult. I am progressively feeling more alone and depressed. I'm not really sure what to do.
TL;DR: "," How can you and your husband create a balance between spending time together and him utilizing his phone for work and relaxation?

Once my work got my laptop from the prosecutor's office, they knew that my story of ""losing"" it at a restaurant was bogus and fired me on the spot.

TITLE: I (19M) am trying to get over my friend (18F) that I have feelings for.
POST: Okay, so here's my predicament. Me and my friend are decently close. Not close like anything romantic, but as close as two friends can be. We know each other pretty well, and we're pretty comfortable around each other at this point. My main issue is that I'm straight, and she's pansexual. I think she's given up on guys entirely because she recently came out to her family as lesbian. Now, I have feelings for her, but she does not have any feelings for me. But here's the heavy hitter.

She does things like she does have feelings for me. Nothing romantic, but we talk on a nearly every day basis, she texts and calls me over all people when she's bored, and now she wants to get an apartment with me. Now, I'm alright with this, but I'm confused as to why she's doing these things. She has, straight up said to me, that she doesn't have romantic feelings for me. But I'm confused as to whether or not she does. She's said before that she's had past relationships that've turned out awful. I tend to not ask her about them, but the pattern in her relationships with guys is that they're dating, they break up, they don't associate with each other anymore. 

Is she just lying to me so we don't risk not associating with each other if we do get together and break up? Or is she legitimately not interested? If she really isn't interested, then how do I get her out of my head? She's everything I've wanted in a woman. She is THE perfect type for me. I mean, we have the same preferences for just about everything, and I'm very attracted to things that describe her, (dimples, brunette, short, girly, cutesy, etc.) but should I just forget about ever taking a step forward with her and just be perma-friend-zoned? I tend to overthink things a lot, so am I doing just that, and I should just forget about anything romantic between us?

POST: So I (19/F) would like to do more things with my boyfriend (22/M), but I can't think of what to do. It seems like everything I suggest or come up with, he doesn't like and doesn't want to do. I wanted to go swimming, so we went to a pool with one of our roommates, but he refused to go in with us, and just sat at the other end of the pool and watched. Right now Im not in school as it's summer vacation, so I have been pretty bored at home since I only work part-time. I often want to go and get out of the house, not really caring what we do. But everything I can think of he never wants to do! I try asking him what he wants to do, and what he likes, but he almost always says ""I don't know."" 

Now another issue, is he enjoys playing WoW a lot. I don't care if he plays it, but I do hate when he makes me wait because hes playing the game. Sure we are sitting at home doing nothing, im surfing reddit, hes playing the game, thats fine. Its when I need to go somewhere, and I have to wait 15 minutes sometimes more, until he is finished his raid or whatever hes doing in the game.

TITLE: Elbow pain while throwing
POST: I am 16 and I play baseball for my highs school varsity team. I was pitching in a scrimmage on Wednesday and while I was warming up I felt a pop on the inside of my elbow, it didn't hurt that bad or anything so I didn't think much of it and went ahead and pitched. Although when I started pitching I noticed that I was throwing around 20 mph slower than normal and I couldn't throw strikes to save my life. After I was done pitching I was put at catcher and whenever someone stole second base and I tried to throw them out my throw would be super slow and end up rolling or slowly bouncing to the second basemen. After all that when we were finishing up practice I took my compression sleeve off and the inside of my elbow was in a lot of pain, I told my mom and she made a doctors appointment for Friday. So the next day at practice I was warming up and stretching and my elbow popped again while throwing and it became painful to throw. So on Friday at the doctor I described my symptoms and stuff and he just kind of looked at it and said I probably had golfers elbow. Where I live there isn't a lot of baseball played so he didn't do any of the tests to check for any torn ligaments or something and he said come back in three weeks if it is still bugging me and to not pitch during that time. What my concern is, is that I tore or strained my ucl and that I may need surgery.

There are several towers, and I live in the smallest and farthest tower, which also is the least occupied, so the parking around my tower entrance generally isn't a problem. 

However, the complex's A/C machinery is right up against the spots for the tower, so it can be difficult to open your driver door if someone parks too close to the line. 

This douche with a Cayenne GTS has been making it difficult to park the last week, so I've been waiting for the right amount of inches to pull this off. 

He parked today a little to close, but just enough for me to get out with no issues; however he won't be able to get in without figuring out which apartment my car belongs to and me pulling out.

I also have never mentioned him on my social media but that is because I barely use it. Last status I've posted was months ago. I also was following by example, he never mentioned me so I never mentioned him because I felt he would not want me to. 

Now all the friends that he actively hangs out with and his family all know we are dating, and if we go out he will always introduce me as his girlfriend. So this is a bit conflicting. It seems as if he his hiding his relationship online but not that way in person. 

Today it really got to me because we were out for a birthday dinner for a friend and he tagged the other people we went with but not me. And many times when I buy him something or bring him food he will take a picture of it and in the caption act like he was one who got it. It's annoying to me.

POST: My boyfriend is 19 and I'm 18. We've been together for three years. My boyfriend is a huge gamer; It's pretty much the only thing he does, spending all day/night playing. This doesn't bother me at all as he should do what he loves. 

I do occasionally play games, and my boyfriend would like me to play online with him. 
The problem is I can't afford to buy the specific games he wants me to get as I just started my first year at university. I only have what I've saved from working this and last summer, and half has already been used up from tuition, textbooks, and driver's ed. I feel like I should be saving for any future expenses that should come up. I looked into buying Guild Wars 2, like he wanted, but it's $60. 

I'd also like to play Minecraft with him, as it's less expensive, but I don't own a credit card and my parents would say no to using theirs even if I payed them back. 

Even when I agree to play free to download games with him, it seems like I never have time. During the summer I was either working, or too tired and just wanted to lie down or sleep. Now, I'm either at school all day, or reading and doing assignments. 

I haven't told him about the money issue as it's a little embarrassing, but he thinks the other reasons may be excuses. We don't get to see each other often so he'd like to use this as an opportunity to sort of bond. He gets annoyed when I say I can't play when he asks right away sometimes. 

How can explain this to him in a way that doesn't seem like excuses and that he understands?
Any tips on how to manage my time better so that I do have time?

TITLE: I [22F] made the mistake of seeing my husbands [25M] Facebook messages.
POST: 22 Female, married for 2 years, together for 5, with 25 male and we have one daughter, 3 years old. We have always been very open with our social media networking, often asking the other one to check notifications, messages, etc for ourselves. I recently learned about the ""others"" folder on Facebook and saw I had a bunch of unseen messages, decided to check my husbands as he has no access to a computer. 

It turned out to be lucky I did because he had an important familial message in there, but I also ended up finding messages to women, and an ex whom he had an extensive and close relationship with, that contradicted a lot of things I had previously believed. Nothing so terrible that it outright proved cheating, but messages like ""I still love you, I'm sorry for the way things ended, I think about you a lot"" (to the ex) and messages that were highly flirtatious and lacked mentioning of being in a committed relationship to various ""friends"". Previously he had told me these women were hitting on him, contacting him, etc. and now I know this isn't true.

I'm really not too distressed as they all were BEFORE we got married, but I feel a bit angry. If he lied about small stuff like that, it seems highly likely that at some point he cheated on me. It doesn't help that we are in a long distance relationship as of last week, and will be for the next 5 months. 

So I KNOW it's my fault for clicking the link, it was so stupid of me but honestly I didn't even expect to see anything of the likes! At this point in our relationship do I just let it go?

POST: I'm from germany, my impression of the american law enforcement is created through the internet. And as you can guess, it's almost only bad news you read on the net. But I'm sure that this isn't representative at all.

So here is my story. I was on a student exchange in Berlin and some friends and I were getting pretty drunk and were partying all over town. So after a long night we finally decided it was time to head to our hotel. But upon leaving the club we realized that we had no idea how to get back. Berlin is pretty huge and the only thing we knew was the name of the street our hotel was in. And as poor students that we were, there also wasn't the option of taking a cab. Also it was the pre-iPhone time so no GPS guidance for us.

We ended up running in circles with no idea where to go. Somehow two cops must have seen us running this way again and again. So this police car stops right near us and the window rolls down. The officer asks us if we are lost. We told him our story and where we needed to go. He then starts to explain to us (we were obviously still drunk) where we need to go.

As the explanation got longer and longer the other cop says ""Look at these guys do you think they'd even find the way around the next corner? And by the way even I wouldn't know where to go after your explanation. Come on hop in guys."". So this two police officers ended up taking some drunken tourists home to their hotel. Oh and the best thing was, not everyone of us was in the legal age for drinking.

I expressed this to my MOH when the shower date had been decided.  My aunts are taking care of the shower duties, so I told my MOH not to worry about the shower, she would have time to focus on the bachelorette planning.  

Well my shower is next week and I found out today that the other bridesmaids have not been contacted about the bachelorette party.   Two of them already had plans set up with their close families for their Saturday evening since they were visiting from out of town.  I'm completely shocked and have no clue on how to talk to the MOH about this.  

It's not like the MOH and I haven't discussed the party. Last weekend we decided on the restaurant we were planning on going to.  I asked her to contact another bridesmaid for ideas on clubs afterwords. So we've kept in contact about the bachelorette party plans, but apparently the rest of the bridesmaids have no clue its happening. At this point it looks like it's just going to be me, her and a friend of mine that will be in town.  Any ideas on what to do?

POST: This girl likes me.  We've been on a few dates.  On paper she's really everything I'm looking for.  The only problem is I don't feel the same about her.  I've naturally developed crushes on girls and it feels wrong to try to make a relationship out of something where I don't feel anything in the beginning.  However, it's not exactly like I'm getting jumped left and right by supermodels so I don't want this to be a lost opportunity.  

But part of me feels like if I keep trying to make myself like her, I'll have a mental block against actually liking her.  I've met girls before whom i didn't have a crush on and developed one over time, but I don't know if that will happen when the possible relationship is blaring in my face right from the beginning.

POST: Hey /RA, you all have been of great help to me in the past so here I am again. This is a throwaway account btw. Here's the skinny:

I'm a single 29 year old male living in North Carolina. I'm a good guy, I'm decent looking, and I'm really easy to get along with. My problem is that I just can't find a girl that makes me happy and is accepting of the fact that I'm atheist. Since I've lived here (5 years) I've had one serious girlfriend who held the same beliefs as me and I truly thought she was the one, until she broke up with me that is. 

Since then I've gone on countless dates with girls that either weren't interested in me or had a serious problem accepting the fact that I don't believe in a higher power. Honestly, the happiest I've been in a relationship in the past three years was when I dated a Thai girl who was visiting the US for 6 months. She could've cared less what my beliefs were and everything was great ... until she went back to Thailand. She didn't have any desire to stay in the US as all of her family was still in her hometown so there was just no way to make that work. I should also add that I dated a Chinese girl while I was living and working in China earlier this year and had the same experience - religion was simply not an issue. So what do I do Reddit? I'm seriously considering looking in other states or even overseas for a companion but I just don't know if that could work. I can't move out of NC for the foreseeable future but traveling to another state/country for a few weeks is not a problem. Do any of you know someone that's actually had success with finding an SO in another state/country online? Am I just completely out of my mind for even considering this?

TITLE: I [20M] have dreaded hanging out with my family more and more every day.
POST: Let me give back story, I live with my cousin and family friend in an apartment. 

My family consists of my mom [51] and dad [48] my eldest sister [25] and her husband [23] my older sister [23] and her husband [24] me [20] and my younger sister [19].

My family has always been very close, and every Sunday and Wednesday we all hang out at my parents' house (due to church bringing us all together) 

Most of what goes on these days are board games, lunch/dinner, and often a round of disc golf. 

For a while I was all down for it, it was fun and I love my family so hanging out was great. But more and more every day I start hating it. Often when I consider staying home or hanging out with my family I really wish I could just stay home.

My family is very loud, and outgoing, and to some people probably very overwhelming. Board games and disc golf promote a very competitive environment which can be annoying sometimes. I'm not anti-competition but sometimes I don't wanna compete, I just want to relax. 

However, declining an invitation to play a game or go for a round of disc golf is usually met with heckles and fun being made. Often times these visits just end up with me being annoyed and frustrated and just wanting to go home. So my 1st inclination is to just stay away.

But the last thing I would want to do is disappoint everyone by being a loner and just ""stay at home and do nothing"". I want to be a part of my family but often I can't stand being around them for extended periods or at all.

TITLE: My love interest [22 F] is on the fence about getting into a relationship with me [22 M/F] due to passion vs. comfort.
POST: I've been seeing this girl about a month before college ended, and we've known each other since the our first year of college. I considered her one of my good friends. At the end of college, we had a friends with benefits relationship until I started having feelings for her. We both had our summer vacations and trips, but now we'll be living around the same area as we begin our respective careers.

Last week, we talked about the potential relationship looming in my head. It's weird because while I would like for us to get into a relationship, she's confused about her desires, which in turn confuses me.

Because she's known me as a friend first, she feels comfortable around me, but it's not a fiery passion like her past relationships. However, she mentions that all of those relationships ended in a disaster, and she's confused as to if she should pursue this one. She's told me she's willing to give it a shot and work towards it. She's obviously interested in the relationship, but the factors holding her back.

I really like her, but I'm not sure if I should pursue a relationship with her feelings in mind. Maybe I'm afraid of getting hurt or wasting my time when I can have a stable friendship instead, as I move into the 8-5 work world. I'm unsure what to do and it is driving me crazy.

Is it worth my time if we're not a THE match? Should I even bother? My heart says go for it, but my brain is telling me to think about it, and my gut isn't responding.

POST: I am a 22 year old male who is about to graduate college at the end of the year. Throughout my whole life, I had one girlfriend.....and it lasted a few weeks (wasn't that fruit-full). Besides that one girl, I have had no experience in any relationship what-so-ever. For many years it took over me, from middle school till last week; I was thinking something was wrong with me for not having any relationship experience. I know I'm not a social outcast or anything, but dating wasn't in my radar for most of my life. 
  Then I realized something, that one day someone special will come along for me and you, heck I might not even expect it, but I am keeping myself from worrying anymore. I need to focus more on who I am and making my own identity. Plus I'm still young and I got my whole life ahead of me; I'm moving soon to a fantastic area for my career in the coming years, I'll be doing what I love and be around people who have the same passion as I do. Who knows, I'll probably run into her there, but for now, I'm not going to let society worry me to death about being single :)

So being the massive idiot i am i text 'Hi' back. I didn't really want to speak to her so i kept writing short replies to her questions and eventually Katrina asks 'Do you even like me anymore?' to which my reply is 'tbh i have had enough'. This is where everything goes to shit.

So Katrina starts having a go at me saying i put her through shit and she never knew why she went out with me and loads of shit like that and eventually it turned into threats. Katrina said 'You won't see me anymore and if you do i will beat the shit out of you and so will David' (David is not the real name of her new boyfriend).

POST: Her and I dated for almost a year and we fighted a lot. It was a normal relationship with its ups and downs. We had a great time with each other but toward the end it got messy. We both started distancing ourselves from each other and we eventually agreed that a breakup was nessesary. After we broke up she started seeing another guy and the started messing around. They had a lot of sex and whatnot then they started dating. I hooked up with my friend but nothing else came of it and it wad the end of that. A few days ago she called me up and she said that she couldn't be with this new guy anymore because there was no spark, she wanted me back.
I met up with her and I told her that I would consider getting back together with her but I wanted to know that she'd change for the better. She had problems in our last relationship. She lied more often than she should have. She swears she never cheated on me and I know she didn't, and she was always sketchy about who she was texting.

TITLE: Google / Facebook: Stop selling data, start selling honest products to your users
POST: I like communicating through social networks, it's the way our generation communicates. I love to share things and I love to use high end products on the web. 

What I don't like is that services like Facebook and Google, which have probably the most advanced products on the market treat their users like shit. They're breaking amendments(e.g. Like Button), they're dishonest and they sell your deepest secrets to anyone who pays enough.

I deleted my Facebook 1 year ago, but I still have the need to communicate (job/private) through social networks. Since there aren't many alternatives to Facebook (basically they have a monopole) I'm forced to use them and I want to use them because their product is amazing. Same with Google, I use quite a lot of their services and I'm very happy with them, but I just don't like that they are selling my data to who knows whom. 

**MY REQUEST**

Offer Premium services. I am willing to pay e.g. 5€/$ per month to get the certainty that my data will be only used to improve my personal experience of the products. 

I want to have insight on all the data that is being collected on me and I want full control over it(delete what ever you want/disable data collection). 

People that don't want/can't pay 5/month will still be able to use the service, but under the circumstance that their data will be sold for advertisement purposes.

I don't know how much they make of selling my usage data to advertisers, but I can't imagine that they will go bankrupt by offering honest services. 

**What does Reddit think, would you be willing to pay for Facebook/Google?

TITLE: Should I take out unsubsidized federal student loans if I don't HAVE to?
POST: Hello pf, I start college soon and from the estimates I've made so far my scholarships and grants pay for enough my tuition, housing, and insurance for this semester to leave ~2000 dollars left to loans and cash. 

My financial package for this semester offers:

$1750 federal subsidized loan 

$1000 federal unsubsidized loan

both with interest rates of 3.76% according to [this link] at least 

I currently have 3000 in the bank, and if everything goes smoothly over the next week I will have 4000 saved up. 

Currently I was thinking that I would take out the full subsidized loan because the interest is paid while I'm in school and the amount is relatively little and pay for the rest in my cash. I will also have to pay for books this semester, however I estimate my book cost will only be about 150-200 dollars at most if I can't find any free options online. This leaves me with about 300-500 dollars of expenses to pay for out of pocket for this semester out of my 3000-4000 I have in the bank. 

I was wondering, however, what pf would think of also taking out the 1000 unsub loan as well since it is a very low interest rate and would help keep me flexible in case shit hits the fan throughout the semester, as I will have money in the bank if I need it. My dad has agreed to pay for my food costs, as I will be doing my own cooking, but that could change and I like knowing that I have a cushion in the bank. Also this is my first semester in college, so I have no idea what other unforeseen expenses I may have to pay for.
TL;DR: "," What financial risks should I consider before taking out an unsubsidized federal student loan? 
2. Are there any other alternatives to financing my college expenses other than taking out a loan"

POST: I've been reading this subreddit for some time now, looking at all of the motivated wolves ready to kick some ass and take some names.  I hope every single one of them succeeds, but I can't help but wonder if they will really accomplish what they set out to do.  We've all been here: so motivated from an awesome speech, movie, quote, book, etc. but, we lose sight of the goal and slack off until another motivational reddit post fires up our hearts again.  What I see here is a vicious cycle of highs and lows.  I'm starting a new ""project"" to see if I can successfully get out of this cycle of, let's face it, procrastination and shame.

Any informational/motivational books, videos, etc. that I come across that help me reach this goal I will share.

My plan is to create a journal and log my achievements, my failures (and how I got through them), and my emotions at all of the times.

I will not leave out details (aside from names and personal information).  IF it works, this will be how an ""every day normal guy"" found his own way to success.

I'll probably post the project on a blog once I've written enough, unless there's some tool on reddit that I don't know about.  The finished product can take months or years to really notice improvement, and it might not ever end.  I'm new to reddit so be understanding.

TITLE: I (18/f) think I might have ended our (19/m) conversation poorly.
POST: We have been together for about a month now, but we have known each other since we were fifteen and dated for about a year in hs. Our feelings for each other have never gone away and we have continued to text each other. Now we are both in college and relatively close (approx 80 mi), and have decided to take one last shot at it. We said from the beginning that if things don't work this time, we are absolutely never going to try again.

The problem is, my family moved after my graduation, to a different state, and he is now realizing how hard it is going to be for us to see each other. We haven't talked for a bit besides texting, and I thought maybe it was because he's sick/with family or the combination. We called today and talked, and I finally asked what I had wanted to: Do you think we're going to work? He said he wasn't sure (which I was hoping for him to say; I think it's good he realizes this). But then he continued about how he doesn't like calling or Skyping because he knows that we can't see each other for a while, and because he says he wants to be with me all the time but he knows he can't. A lot was covered in the call, including that he's ""a pessimist, it's always going to be like this,"" etc. and that he generally thinks nothing good will come of his life and he is unhappy. No matter what I tried, he countered it. The basis of our conversation focused on: we can work with what we have and continue as we are, or we can break up. I kinda broke down and ended the call with, ""Call me when you're ready to believe in yourself.""

I'm freaking out. I want to cry, but can't. I only eat so my family won't worry, but my mom and one of my brothers can already see that something is wrong, and they can probably guess what it is. I want to call him back or at least send a text, but I have no idea what move to take. Any advice?

After he said that I started to connect the dots I guess I noticed a while ago he started calling names that you usually use for a bf or gf.

I've believed for a while now that we'd be better off without labels and the sort; they had their purpose before, but now with the availability of recording gear and software along with the Internet for artists to promote themselves, why do we need this conglomeration of suits and ties who take cuts from everything the artists do?

When I played music, I didn't care about making money off of it. On the road, I needed a few bucks here and there for peanut butter sandwiches, but little would make me happier than for someone to want to listen to my music, even if that meant they went home and pirated it.

POST: I am a Chinese born Canadian, she is a Ukrainian/Scandinavian Canadian. We met through a mutual friend, and have it hit off real well. We are at the point of our relationship where we'd like to introduce each other to our parents, somewhat looking for their blessing to advance the relationship to the next stage.

For the most part, she has been pressing the relationship forward - and wanted me to meet her parents. I have no issues with that and am actually looking forward to it. However, she had indicated that her parents have a preference for a Caucasian match for her - she has yellow fever and is not into Caucasians at all - but she see is a tad worried about her parent's opinion still. I am indifferent because I've dated all races, and my parents are indifferent as well.

Is there any advice in terms of how I may be able to overcome her parent's racial biases - or, lead the conversations down a path which takes the focus and emphasis on this particular subject?

Some background information - 
- We're both homosexuals. 
- Relationship has been going for around 2 months now
- We were best friends before the relationship
- Our relationship is a secret because she doesn't want to come out

Basically, I want to break up with this girl. My reasons being is that I never actually see her. I work during the weekends and we both had exams a few weeks ago. I only met her twice in the past 3 weeks. Whenever I ask her to hang out she's either busy revising, with her family or hanging out with other friends
I had an argument with her about her hanging out with an ex and she told me she didn't want to be with them anymore and that she was only friends with him (I got upset because I hadn't seen her in days and she told me she was busy when I caught her in town with him)

Yesterday she messaged me asking to meet up with her and I said ""sure, whenever I guess, I'm free all week"" she took my message the wrong way and told me that if i didn't want to meet then it's fine. I told her I didn't mean it like that and asked her to meet me today, she then said she was busy all day today and tomorrow. By this point I just want to end it because it doesn't feel like a relationship anymore.

[Aug 2011]

It all started when i meet Jane at a friend's birthday party last year. We felt an instant connection and mutual attraction, two weeks after she asked me on a date (yay for girls who take initiative). Fast forward a couple of months and everything was going OK, we hanged out on a weekly basis and talked on the phone of IM almost daily. 

[April 2012]

Everything was going just fine until her birthday, she invited a bunch of friend to a local pub and she just ignored me all night, we didn't talk at all that night. 

Then a friend of her started to talk to me (i don't remember her name, i never saw her again, sorry). She told me how much Jane talks about me and how much she likes me and it was odd she wasn't paying any attention to me that night. Somehow that made me feel a little better.

After than night Jane declined every single one of my invitations, at first she always made up any excuse (work, study, etc. you name it) and then she just ignored my texts and phone calls. I even invited her to my birthday party and she didn't even bothered telling me she wouldn't come.

I just rationalized that she just doesn't like me anymore, i was really heartbroken at the time and i felt like i couldn't do anything about it.

[Aug 2012]

Fast forward to my friend's birthday party this year (one year after i meet Jane) and we talked again for the first time in almost half a year, she complained to our friends that i don't invite her anymore, that i don't talk to her anymore and that I just ignored her after her birthday party.

TITLE: I [20 F] feel totally unappreciated by my boyfriend [22 M] of four years, and am feeling as though the relationship has run its course.
POST: Hey r/relationships,

First time poster, sorry if I'm doing anything wrong.

My boyfriend and I have been together for just over four years, and spent a lot of time apart while we were both working on college stuff. We've been living together for the past year and I've never felt worse about our relationship. I feel like I don't know the cause behind this downward spiral either.

Basically, we wake up early in the morning, are apart from each other all day while working and going to class (he's a senior and I'm a sophomore at our university), and then we carpool home around 6:00. We usually eat together but after that he's on his computer for the rest of the night. I constantly feel like I'm bothering him when I ask if he wants to hang out or have sex. 

His libido has really dropped to the point where we have sex maybe three times a week, when I've tried to convey that I'd want to every day. 

I feel like I cater to his needs while he is totally dismissing mine. I make almost all of his meals, I clean the space that we're renting, I take care of our pets, and he doesn't lift a finger unless I literally beg.

I hate talking about him like this because I feel that we never had these problems before. I just wonder if I should get out of this and find someone that maybe appreciates me or is willing to talk to me and have a closer relationship. I'm currently in therapy trying to work on anxiety and depression, and he doesn't seem to get that a little love would be great right about now.

Has anyone been through this before? Any advice to offer? Thanks in advance for any replies.

POST: I'm dating and sleeping with a man 28 years older than me, no one knows, because honestly I fear their initial reaction. I'm 24 and he's 52. Ive been through a lot which has made me more mature, more mature than the average 24 year old i'd say. My dad died when I was 17, very sudden, and that left scars and a lot of unanswered questions. My mum is there but not supportive emotionally, though she would support me financially if needed ( just to mention my background) I'm a student at uni, finishing my degree in a year. I have my own flat, a job, and i'm generally doing fine. I met this man at my local favorite bookshop, and we exchanged emails as we seemed to have chemistry. Well yeah we did! But now I feel as if society is against us, we refrain from kissing and hugging when we're out and even when we're alone I feel sort of dirty, as if I have daddyissues or i'm just seeing him because I didnt have my dad or something like that. It bothers me because I dont feel like i'm ""damaged"" or even have daddyissues, but I Think that's what other people are thinking when we're out. That he's just an old pig and i'm armcandy. He's not rich though, leads a normal life and all that.
I just need some advice. Should I look deeper into why i'm with this man, or just accept the fact that he's older and that that has nothing to do with any ""issues"" of his or mine.

TITLE: I need to do something cool for my girlfriend, but I don't know what... help me please, reddit!
POST: So, long story short, last week I had a huge fight with my then girlfriend, I behaved like an asshole and reacted in a way I shouldn't have, we broke up; afterwards, we have been talking again, I'm trying to change some of my shitty attitudes towards her and people in general, and she told me she is willing to take me back.

The problem here is that she says I never really made an effort to be with her, so in order for us to get back together I've gotta do something cool for her... in her words she told me: ""She won't take me back unless I show her I'm willing to do a real effort to be with her, and that I should think outside of my box and go out of my way, as she is not easily impressed"". Now, I know in this context this might sound like a stupid demand of hers, but it actually makes sense as I never made any real effort and she wants to see me try and do something cool for her.

I've asked for a lot of female advice and most people say stuff like I should cook for her, or give her a massage or stuff like that, but I don't think that's really demanding or challenging, I wanna do something that's really cool and meaningful, not necessarily flashy or ultra expensive, but to create an amazing experience for her...

POST: So I've been using Vanilla Visa and other such gift cards for a while online, because I've been paranoid about fraudulent charges on credit cards. Had those fears affirmed lately, though maybe if it were a credit card I'd have more recourse.

Bought some stuff, and was checking my balance to see how many mp3s I could get with the remainder when I notice two weird charges, pending for 75 cents and one dollar respectively, but I'm worried that they might ask for more, and then what?

The first, the 75 cent charge, is from a construction company in Druid Hills, Texas who I can't find on Google, and they gave no phone number. According to Wikipedia, there are places called Druid Hills in Georgia and Kentucky, but not Texas.

The next, the $1 charge, is from AT&T. I call them up, and am asked which number I'm calling about before I can go any further. I am not an AT&T customer. I go to their website and see if I can e-mail them about this, but yeah customer support is for customers only.

I shouldn't worry too much, all they should be able to take is the remaining balance of less than $5 anyway. But if these fraudulent charges are connected to my identity and they come knocking, what then?

TITLE: I [22/F] am leaving my SO [23/M] to go back home.
POST: I'm not wanting advice about the relationship, because it was one of the best I've had.

We've been dating for over a year. 2 months ago, I moved 3,000km away to be with him and I just can't handle being so far from my family. The way of life here is very different for someone like me (small town, farm girl, language barrier), so I have decided to move back home. It's killing me but I'm literally miserable here. He does not want to do long-distance.

He understands and is helping me pack and I'm leaving on good terms, but I'm so heartbroken it hurts and I have to drive all the way back by myself.

TITLE: Me [26 F] with my lover [40 M], 6 months, I am the other woman: Do I tell his wife?
POST: I am the other woman. I have been for 6 months now. A few days ago he had a child with his wife. This came as a surprise to me, he told me the day she was born. I'm shocked and I'm pissed. I was under the impression that he was getting a divorce. He never wanted kids. 

The backstory is lengthy. He is a lecturer at the university I attend. I am a graduate student. After a year of enjoying each other's company professionally, we fell into a deep and passionate relationship. Although the situation sounds cliché, I want to say it's different. He has had issues with his wife, this is known by many. We click, if the situation were more amenable, we would be together. This being said, he has been hiding the pregnancy of his wife from me for the time we have been together - he didn't want to give up the opportunity to be with me.

Since I am angry, of course I want to reciprocate the pain. I want to tell her about our relationship. I want her to know about me and I want him to suffer the consequences. I'm aware that this isn't a fantastic reason, but is this really a bad idea? If I do tell her, what should I say/how should I do it?

TITLE: Husband constantly ignores important holidays.
POST: Me (27F) He (25M) married 4 years

So guys, it's valentines, I should be inundated with cheesy, cliche romance. (Haha, I'm being facetious) Yet I'm crying myself to sleep again.

My husband is the worst with holidays. Not just hallmark days but our anniversary, my birthday etc.
At first I thought he was clueless, so I would tell him explicitly what I wanted and remind him of the date. I never want anything big or expensive, just ""let's go out as a family, maybe grab some lunch.""
He always sounds keen, we talk plans then on the day he will magically be inundate with work that absolutely must get done this Instant, or act shocked that I was serious about doing something. My last birthday I had to buy my own gift cake and dinner.

Every time I obviously get upset, then he gets huffy that i am upset and begrudgingly tries to fix it. Not because he thinks he fucked up, but because I'm all mad at him. Eg my birthday, 2 months later I get a gift.

I know holidays like V day are silly but I think it's important to take that time to stop and appreciate each other. I got him a bunch of his favourite treats, cooked him dinner and didn't even get any acknowledgement.

I just am so tired of getting my hopes up only to spend the entire holiday feeling worthless while everywhere I look is a reminder of how little my husband gives a shit.

What is the best way to talk to him about this? It isn't the holidays themselves, it's more his behaviour of getting my hopes up, dashing them that morning then getting mad that I'm upset.

POST: I just got out of a 16 month relationship at the beginning of December.  I had never shared so much of my life with anybody until she came along, and we were essentially inseparable since we met.  We literally shared the same bed every night and shared every day together (other than the summer, we live in different states outside of college).  She told me so many times that I was her best friend, her favorite person, and that she had never loved anyone the way she loved me.  

Well fast forward to this past fall semester of college and she began acting more selfish, was snappier, and seemed to take me for granted.  It caused me so much stress, anxiety, depression, and numerous nights of lost sleep.  I still made every sacrifice possible, but she still acted bitter and unfair to me.  I couldn't help but remember the sweet, gorgeous girl I fell in love with, so I did anything to try and make her happy again.

Throughout the last, oh, 6 months of our relationship I had this sense that she was hooking up with her ex.  She said that he was just her ""best friend"" and that I had nothing to worry about.  Well today I see on Facebook that she's in a fucking relationship with this ugly motherfucker.

I put so much energy into this relationship and I honestly thought I found the love of my life.  I'm so used to thinking about her, talking to her, texting her, sharing everything with her.  I know she's a terrible person, a liar, and a conniving twat, but I can't let go of the amazing feeling I had once had from being with her.  How do I get this awful bitch out of my head?

POST: My journey started on a Saturday night in a Kebab shop. 

A very drunk man was talking to some of the patrons. I was so anxious that he would talk to me, I could feel the panic setting in. I made my way to the furthest corner of the shop silently praying he would not talk to me. Thankfully he didn't and on the car ride home I say to my SO: 

me: ""wow, my social anxiety is just getting worse and worse. I would have had a panic attack if he had spoken to me"" 

so: (staring straight ahead) ""maybe your anxiety is getting worse because you're not, uh, comfortable in your body anymore..."" 

me: ""What? (*disbelief*) No way! It's because that drunk guy was going to talk to me. I don't want strangers talking to me...!"" 

We are silent on the car road home and I have suddenly realised that he is right. My social anxiety has proportionately worsened as my weight has gone up and up. I vow to myself that I am going to make a change and so I start just tracking my calories, a month later I start c25k... 

And today I have lost 22lbs with a further 44lbs to go! I am so stoked and so pleased I have started to make a change for the better.

TITLE: My [21F] asexuality is causing problems with my boyfriend [22M].
POST: I'm asexual, and he is not. So when we are in the heat of the moment, and he is in the rush of feelings and hormones, I am in my usual state of mind. 

I try to be into it, but it's very hard for me to do so, since I don't have adrenaline or anything helping me out. He wants me to take control and try different things, but like I said before, it's difficult for me to do it, and it kind of ruins the mood for us. 

Sometimes, when the sex is really fast, everything seems okay, but when he wants to take things slowly, that's when it all seems to go wrong. It usually ends in him just masturbating and then cumming on me, which I don't mind, but I know it's not what he wants. Sometimes, it usually ends in one of us being annoyed and frustrated.

I like him a lot, and he says the same for me, but I feel like the relationship is doomed if we can't get over this.

TITLE: I [F29] am with my BF [32M] of 5 years, he is not ambitious at all, which freaks me out.
POST: Long time lurker, first time posting here. Using a throwaway. Apologies if post becomes too long. 

I have been in relationship with Jake for 5 years now, living together for last 2 years and have seen our share of up and downs.Last year or two I feel like he has stopped putting effort into our relationship/ life. He is not super ambitious type which is fine with me. But he is stuck in dead end job which he is not ready to give up. I have asked him to apply to other positions but it's never taken too seriously, for too long. We decided to take language courses together just to keep our minds fresh/ learn something new. New language skill can help both our careers. I finished two, while he hasn't completed a single. This was after deciding what he wants to do, language would not have been my first choice, but I tried. I am self-learner, I like to pick new challenges, keep improving myself. I don't see him doing the same.  I have other examples which I can give but for the sake of anonymity [if someone needs I can provide]. It has caused friction between us for now an year. 

Just for the other side of coin. He is attractive, has sense of humor, is very good with people, listens well, quite generous (looks after my ""needs"" first, or at-least makes sure equally contained!) and so on. But when it comes to life he has very laid back approach that freaks me out. 

I just need an outside perspective. My friends know us well and I feel they cannot give that 3rd person view, without some prejudice. Not sure if this time for ultimatum.
TL;DR: "," What are the specific goals and ambitions that you have for yourself and your relationship with Jake? 
2. What steps have you taken to encourage Jake to pursue his goals and ambitions?

TITLE: Should I [19/f] tell my best friend [19/m] that I know about his girlfriend [23/f] he's kept a secret from me?
POST: Some backstory. We have been good friends for a little more than a year now and we briefly dated about 8 months ago. We decided to go back to being just friends but I definitely still have feelings for him. We hang out all the time and talk every day and refer to each other as our best friends. 

I went over his house the other day and his sister brought up his girlfriend. (they're not technically boyfriend girlfriend. They're in a relationship without the title. Yet his family calls her his girlfriend. He did the same thing with me when we first started talking.) Apparently they have been together since winter. I had no idea he was dating her and they all thought I knew. Basically I'm very hurt that he kept this a secret from me and lied to me. He has no idea that I know. 

His family thinks they're on the decline and he's going to stop seeing her soon. I don't know if I should tell him I still have feelings for him and see if he feels the same or not. I think he may feel the same just because he acts like it most of the time and he hasn't made things official with the girl he's with now. Also he comments a lot on how much I've improved as a person since we were together and how he likes being around me more now. 

I don't know if I should tell him I know either. Basically I just don't want him to get angry at me and stop talking to me for whatever reason. I'm just afraid of his reaction to me bringing it up that I know about her because he kept it a secret for whatever reason. At the same time it's eating me up inside and it's all I can think about, making me feel depressed. I hate the idea of him with another girl. 

Any advice how to bring it up or if I should?

TITLE: Medicaid Eligibility (Michigan)
POST: Greetings, /r/legaladvice. Long time reader, first time caller.

I am a 26-year-old hailing from a wealthy family, but said family is not supporting me. My parents operate a trust fund with me as beneficiary, and there is a sizable sum in that trust fund. But it is off-limits to me at the moment (I am told I will have access sometime in the future, probably the far future), and so for the moment, I am on my own. 

I need health insurance, but I am unemployed (with that unlikely to change until October/November, when I am hopefully admitted to the Michigan bar). I have some money in my own bank account, but not enough to afford health insurance flat-out without a subsidy. I tried to apply for a subsidy, but because I have nearly no income, I was referred to Medicaid. I have been told I cannot get a subsidy unless Medicaid rejects me.

Yet I feel rather unethical accepting Medicaid, given that I am the beneficiary of a rather sizable trust fund. Welfare programs like Medicaid are designed to help the least fortunate in this country -- not some rich kid who just happens to not have access to money at this moment. I do not want to be using funds that could be put to better use helping someone in poverty.

So I am wondering if there is any way for me to be disqualified from Medicaid that wouldn't disqualify me from the subsidies? It would need to be something ethical -- I take very seriously the requirement that attorneys (and would-be attorneys) exhibit integrity at all times.

POST: When I was 22, I moved back in with my mom (parents divorced) for a couple of weeks, while I was in between places.  The first of the two weeks, she was out of town.  Well, my little brother (17) and sister (19) were not.  They asked me to get them alcohol so they could drink the night away at a going away party for a friend.  I NEVER bought alcohol for them, but I really wanted the place to myself, so I made a poor decision.  I was pretty sure they were going to be gone for the night.

On my way home, when I was on the buss I received a text from my mom saying that I should rush home for dinner and stuff. 

The place I lived back then was like a village so the buss was half empty, and at the stop there was only me and a boy around 8 who got off.

The boy was walking like 2 meters in front of me and I got tired of walking so slow so I started running. It was cold and I was hungry so I wanted to get home as fast as possible but the boy in front of me got suddenly worried when he realized someone was running behind him. He looked back at me and saw me running towards his direction, I automatically made eye contact with him and can imagine my retarded face while running, I probably looked scary and dumb at the same time. I could see on his face that he got shit ass terrified when he saw me. Suddenly I stopped running cause I didn't want of him to think I wanted to harm him, and he stopped running too. 

But then I finally thought ""Fuck it, I will start run past him and show that I'm not running after him"" but as I started running he turned his face at me again in terror and started running too. I could see on his expression that he shit his pants and ran like hell to get home.

gay, but the sound of it was driving me crazy. At one point, I just couldn't take it. So I call my dad for him to pick me up from my college while I wait at the

POST: Reddit, I need your help.
I've been with my boyfriend for over a year and we have a very happy relationship. We rarely fight, we crave each others company, and we are both very serious about our relationship. 
The only thing weighing us down are my jealousy issues. 

It is impossible for me to go out ANYWHERE in public (groceries, the mall, the gym) without getting extreme paranoia that he is checking out other girls or thinking how attractive other girls are. When we are not together all I can think about is him looking at porn or gonewild posts on his computer. I can't even watch tv with him because whenever there is an attractive girl on the screen (which is often) I think that he is imagining having sex with her and lusting over her. I basically force us to only watch animated shows together because of this.. and even then the jealousy will still be there. 

However, I am painfully aware of how 'crazy' I'm being. I know that he would never cheat on me, and I know that its natural for people to find other attractive people attractive without it being a sign of infidelity. But knowing that does not stop the feelings of hurt and pain and paranoia.

I have never been cheated on before, but I have witnessed my parents not being faithful to each other. Also, I worry that my self-esteem may be a cause of the issue. I try very hard with my appearance by working out, eating right, but it never feels like enough. 

I just want to be able to relax and enjoy a movie or a walk with my boyfriend. I love my boyfriend with my whole heart but the jealousy is honestly just too painful and damaging. I don't know what to do.

We actually talked yesterday and I told her we should break up because it'll be too painful to have a relationship like that and she said she'd be able to be strong and faithful for me but we did come to the conclusion that we'll break up before I leave. Am I making the right decision?

POST: Hey reddit fans, here is my dilemma.  My wife and I are going through a mostly amicable divorce.  Things have been wrong for a while and while she loves me she is no longer in Love with me.  She started hinting at this last fall and I have been blind to it as I do love her and tell her that still to today.  Here is my dilemma;  She found an old high school fuck buddy on Facebook.  He too is in a failing relationship but has not had the talk with his wife. To keep the level of scrutiny he is under down he had her create a fake profile on Facebook as a member of the opposite sex so their most innocent of daily banter is hidden, less obvious.  She came clean to me about 6 weeks ago about him when I caught her chatting him (I am a service technician and turned screen sharing on on her CPU). He has 4 children with his current wife and a previous; so that she can surreptitiously be part of their lives he has pushed them to friend her fake profile.
When we, as a family, took our children to a Sox game this past week, I posted an image of us on Facebook and tagged her.  The following morning he went off on her and she unfriended me. I love this woman and want her in my life (loser) but she is killing me.

TITLE: This past July, I think my [21 F] boyfriend's [21 M] bestfriend [21 M] was hitting on me. What do I do?
POST: Last July, my boyfriend of 3 years had a small party at his house. There were maybe 15 of us there, all of his friends were quite drunk.

Eventually in the night his best friend comes up to me and puts his arm around me and I'm holding him up because he's almost too drunk to stand on his own. We go inside to get him water, and the whole time he keeps saying things to me like ""You're so cute... you're so sexy."" I keep dismissing him and what he's saying and then everyone else starts to come inside but then he says to me ""You're too good for *my bf*"" I got pretty angry and upset and I said ""You need to stop"" and I walked away from him. 

For a number of reasons at the time, I didn't know how to confront the situation or how to tell my bf. I didn't want him to have to pick between us. And I really wanted to chalk it up to ""The friend was drunk and didn't know what he was doing"" 

But now, I've lost all respect for the best friend, mostly because I think he's a completely shitty person and doesn't deserve my bf in his life. It has been hard for me to be around him, and I almost hate him for it all. I feel horrible as I know I should have told my bf at the time right when this happened. And it constantly eats at me. But now so much time has gone by I don't know what to do...

POST: My friend and I (males) just started living with a girl we floored with in the freshmen dorms last year; we are all 19 and attending the same college. It's a two bedroom apartment, my friend and I share one room and she didn't want a roommate so she lives in the other room alone. Therefore the rent is split 25%, 25%, 50%. We needed another roommate so we could afford the rent and unfortunately she was our only option at the time. 

So, the major problem is her boyfriend. The dude is ok but he is here ALL THE TIME. He's been here everyday and it annoys my friend and I. It makes us uncomfortable because it changes the dynamic and we feel like we have a guest present 24/7 and have to be nice to him, make him feel like good company, and share meals; instead of doing whatever we want and going about our business. You would think she could handle entertaining him but a good amount of times she leaves and he just stays over, and occasionally comes over before she's back from work. Food is scarce because we're college kids but he has been helping himself to our stuff. Additionally they are messy as fuck and it really pisses me off that I've been cleaning up after someone that doesn't even pay rent. He just spilled an entire beer on our carpet and proceeded to use all my paper towels to ""clean"" it up. 

She may be paying the rent of two people, but we didn't sign the lease to live with this guy. We haven't been able to talk to her about this as roommates because he is always here when she is. We want to do this in a civilized manner so we don't have animosity to deal with for 10 more months.

Me and my SO are both 20-something young adults. When we met, we immediately hit off and thus starts our story. We spent togethet probably the best summer ever, but then things go wrong. Enter the manipulative ex-gf, a girl who gets between us a couple of times.. A lot of other shit happened too and being passonate and well, maybe a little immature too, we break up & make up a couple of times, the last time being about four months ago.

We got quickly back together, and my bf seemed to change; he's actually made an effort to keep other people out of our relationship, and he's also been sweet and caring.

Problem is, I found out that during our quick break-ups he made out with a couple of other girls in a drunken haze and later on lied to me about it, because apparently he was too ashamed to tell me. As far as I knew til yesterday was that he kissed his ex last autumn, but oh no.. The number is actually three other girls he kissed and tossed away. I found out because I knew he had erm, asked at least one of these girls' number when we had broken up and he was mad at me, so I confronted him about it.

Things have been going so well lately, but oh man.. Truth be told, I don't think I would've gotten back together with him had I known he actually kissed THREE other girls, and most of these episodes even rooting as far as us breaking up because of his ex. These were dealt with in winter, but obviously he lied to me. He cried last night when he thought I was going to leave him. Things have been better, almost perfect, after we left all that shit behind but now.. How am I supposed to deal with this new info? Obviously he was ashamed and still is, but lying straight to my face? That's bad..

POST: Throwaway to prevent ID by friends/fam.

I'll try and make this quick.  I have been seeing two guys for the past year.  40M isn't very affectionate or emotionally supportive.  Yet every time he calls, texts, or I see him it's like I'm in a trance.  

35M is open-hearted, kind, helpful, sensitive, caring, loving, loyal and giving of himself.  I like him and know he would make a good husband/father but there are just no fireworks.  I would honestly love to feel the intense way I do for 40M, but it just isn't there.  

The biggest difference between the two is that 40M is dominant and I love it. I feel like the best version of myself when I'm with him.  I'm an ambitious, accomplished woman in my own right but he inspires me to set my goals even higher to be on par with him.  35M makes me feel like even if I decided to be complacent in life and not maximize my potential, it would be A-OK.  He just wants the wife, the house, the kids and the white picket fence.  Obviously I'm at that age where it's time to sh*t or get off the pot.  35M wants marriage, now, 40M wants a long term partnership but not marriage (unless with an iron-clad prenup).  35M seems like the smart option; he will be there for me no matter what. 40M I'm not so sure.

I'll try and make this quick.  I have been seeing two guys for the past year.  40M isn't very affectionate or emotionally supportive.  Yet every time he calls, texts, or I see him it's like I'm in a trance.  

35M is open-hearted, kind, helpful, sensitive, caring, loving, loyal and giving of himself.  I like him and know he would make a good husband/father but there are just no fireworks.  I would honestly love to feel the intense way I do for 40M, but it just isn't there.  

The biggest difference between the two is that 40M is dominant and I love it. I feel like the best version of myself when I'm with him.  I'm an ambitious, accomplished woman in my own right but he inspires me to set my goals even higher to be on par with him.  35M makes me feel like even if I decided to be complacent in life and not maximize my potential, it would be A-OK.  He just wants the wife, the house, the kids and the white picket fence.  Obviously I'm at that age where it's time to sh*t or get off the pot.  35M wants marriage, now, 40M wants a long term partnership but not marriage (unless with an iron-clad prenup).  35M seems like the smart option; he will be there for me no matter what. 40M I'm not so sure.  

What say you, Reddit?

TITLE: What am I (38f) going to do? I can't get over him (40m) and I can't cut ties.
POST: My husband of 11 years left me.

We had our problems, but I thought we were lifers.  We've been married 11 years but known each other for 20.  We have 2 young children.

I knew he wasn't happy for a while (but neither was I).  It was just the garbage of life we were dealing with (money problems, family stresses, depression, lack of sex).  We are in a very stressful period of time at the moment (sick extended family members, job issues), and I've been distracted for months.

He told me he was moving out to get some space to think.  Then it became obvious he was seeing someone else.  Then when confronted about it, he said he's not coming back.

I know:  lawyer, gym.  But I'm in shock.  I think it must be shock......it has been 3 weeks now and I still feel icy cold when I think about it.  I got sleeping pills from my doctor.  Husband is someone I don't even recognize.  He's extremely cold towards me and ONLY speaks to me regarding the kids.  Nothing I say breaks through to him.  In fact, he mostly ignores me.

I have no idea how to move on.  I'm dealing with intense anger (that I know working out will help) but I feel so stressed and out of control.  I'm not acting on the anger, but it sometimes feels like borderline rage that I have to stuff down.

I can't go no contact with him.......we have young kids who want to see them.  He wants them as much as possible.  I'm left here in tears while he takes them overnight.  Moving on will be a long tedious process because I'll still have to see him REGULARLY because of the kids.  And I'll have to hear about his life.

My heart is broken.

TITLE: Could I get away with working on a cruise ship and then jumping ship when I got to another country?
POST: So I'm hoping to do some traveling, and airlines are really expensive. It occurred to me that, if I were to enter into service on a crew ship, waiting tables or swabbing decks, I would be getting paid to travel to exotic locales, and then I could just jump ship when I got where I wanted to go. I would be okay with it morally, because I don't feel like cruise ships are doing much of anything positive in the world. I am however totally ignorant about what this would entail. Would I be able to enter the country legally? I was planning on getting a tourist visa stateside. Has anyone tried this? Has anyone worked on a cruise ship? Could you just flesh out my proposal generally, so I know how viable it is? There is a specific place that I am trying to get, but I don't want to go into too many details because I have an inkling that this would be illegal.

TITLE: Reddit, I think I've completely screwed up my future
POST: Somewhere right around the beginning of high school I came down with what I can only assume was a pretty major undiagnosed bout of depression. For about 2 years, I was extremely depressed and had no drive or motivation in my classes. This caused my grades to drop dramatically. 

I'm just finishing up my Junior year in high school, and it's time to start looking for colleges. I'm still pretty smart (I'm not just saying that, I got a 2050 on the SAT and 32 on the ACT) but because of those two years, my GPA is a miserable 2.9, my class rank isn't even in the top half, and I have next to no extracurricular activities. Considering I want to major in computer science, I feel pretty screwed when it comes to colleges. 

Has anyone been through something similar or have some advice for me?

TITLE: I've (M 20) been taking care of my ex's (F 19) dog for about 8-9 months and I'm scared to give him back.
POST: I moved up to Oregon last summer to be closer to my girlfriend, and I started taking care of her dog for her. He's an Italian greyhound chihuahua mix, and he's super sweet. When I first moved here, he had severe anxiety issues and would frequently have accidents all over the house. He didn't eat very much, and cower if anyone walked towards him. 

Now he is happy and healthy. My roommates and neighbors have all noted how much he's improved. Even my ex's parents agree that he's doing much better. 

When I broke up with my girlfriend, we agreed that the dog should stay with me because I was taking such good care of him. Since we broke up, she's only seen the dog about 5 times and only for a few brief moments, and that's 100% her choice. I've been open to her seeing him more.

I'm moving this week, and suddenly she doesn't want me taking him because he's her dog. I have a housing situation worked out and he'll be happy where we're going. We would be a short walk from the beach, and there would be other dogs for him to play with. We would even have a good yard for him to play in. And if I ever end up leaving and if I'm not able to take him, my mom would take over (she loves him and has a few dogs of her own). 

I think my ex wants to keep him solely because he's ""hers"" and as a way to spite me. It's cruel, especially after she has already abandoned him. From what I know, she doesn't have any of his paperwork and her family all believe I should take him.

I'm at a loss as to what I should do. I love him dearly and I want what's best for him, but I'm worried about what the ramifications would be and I don't know how I should go about it. She's asking me when I'll be leaving so she can figure out when to grab him.

She lives her life based on how she feels and I'm the logical type, a mechanical engineering student, I kind of have to have this mindset for my future. But enough with the back story. It seems like every time we call it quits, I go a month or two not hearing from her, only to have her resurface which eventually leads to her attempts of reconciliation. I literally never talk to her again when we do actually seperate, and I always get into the frame of mind that I will never hear from her again, i guess to spare my mind of the pain always wondering if she is even thinking about me (i always figured that's how exes were supposed to behave). I feel I have allowed this for too long, because regardless of what she says it just leads to more hurt later on. Is she using me because she can't find anyone else there, or does she genuinely want to work things out?

TITLE: What's the most unexpected way your best friend affirmed your relationship?
POST: Inspired by this (insanely dis-heartening) post:  where stories of friends' dickishness are told, I have a question. 

Sometimes you just go through the motions in relationships, be it with friends or girlfriends, family, etc. But then there's that odd time when you friend or loved one does something unexpected to show how close you actually are, spontaneous or planned. 

My best friend since kindergarten and I were on a binge-drinking-kind of vacation to the Canary Islands a few years ago. We were about 19 at the time. We were in this trashy euro-disco club at about 4 am (the selection over there isn't great). I was pretty wasted, checking out a girl dancing alone. My friend is over at the bar getting beer, when a big burly guy grabs my shoulder from behind and walks me to a shady corner of the club. I'm not particularily well-built, weighing in around 65 kg at the time, and my friend's not much bigger. This guy was more stallone-esque. It turns out the girl I was looking at was his gf, and he owns the club. Two more even bigger guys (the guards) join us the corner. They don't speak english, I don't speak spanish, so I'm not gonna be able to talk myself out of this one. Looks like I'm going to be roughed up right? I'm all alone, cornered and desperation starts to set in. Suddenly the guys all back up a bit, and I notice that my friend has found me, and joined up right next to me giving the biggest evil eyes I've ever seen to these guys. They back off without any exchange of words, and we got out of there. My friend has never been in a fight and I'd never seen him angry before. But he sure had my back this time, and always have, before and after that, without me realizing it!

My best friend since kindergarten and I were on a binge-drinking-kind of vacation to the Canary Islands a few years ago. We were about 19 at the time. We were in this trashy euro-disco club at about 4 am (the selection over there isn't great). I was pretty wasted, checking out a girl dancing alone. My friend is over at the bar getting beer, when a big burly guy grabs my shoulder from behind and walks me to a shady corner of the club. I'm not particularily well-built, weighing in around 65 kg at the time, and my friend's not much bigger. This guy was more stallone-esque. It turns out the girl I was looking at was his gf, and he owns the club. Two more even bigger guys (the guards) join us the corner. They don't speak english, I don't speak spanish, so I'm not gonna be able to talk myself out of this one. Looks like I'm going to be roughed up right? I'm all alone, cornered and desperation starts to set in. Suddenly the guys all back up a bit, and I notice that my friend has found me, and joined up right next to me giving the biggest evil eyes I've ever seen to these guys. They back off without any exchange of words, and we got out of there. My friend has never been in a fight and I'd never seen him angry before. But he sure had my back this time, and always have, before and after that, without me realizing it!
TL;DR: ", How has your friend's actions affected your relationship since that night?

TITLE: My boss (49f) called me (22f) immature. Do I confront?
POST: I am a nanny. I recently accuired a fantastic job caring for two wonderful kids. Their mother is a workaholic who is very stern and has no idea how children act, or how to handle it.
Today the son (8) told me that his mother said I was immature.

First of all, I am independant and pay for everything that I have. I am immature with the kids, but I'm simply not afraid to get down on the floor and play legos with them. That doesnt seem ""immature"" to me. I also noticed a strength the children have and that is their creativity on the game, Minecraft .I have broadened their horizons and have showed them games on my xbox like Skyrim and Oblivion. I bring my xbox on fridays to let the kids play. Could this also be considered immature?

My feelings are hurt, should I confront it? Write her an email asking what I did that implied I was immature and not a ""grownup""? 

Any opinions are welcome!

TITLE: Is my [26M] GF's [25F] friend greedy or am I wrong?
POST: Hi,

my[26] GF[25] of two years has a good friend who also happens to be a manicurist. Sometimes she does my GF's nails and she is paid for it.

We have invited that friend and her family (husband, kids) over for dinner and my GF would like to have her nails done. Do you think it's normal if my GF's friend insists that she is paid as usual?

1. I do not have a problem if we invite them over as friends (without nail treatment).
2. I do not have a problem if the whole nail thing is handled professionally (without invitation) and that my GF pays her.
3. However, I do find it weird (and personally I would find it embarassing) to show up with the whole family for dinner and then asking for money when leaving.

We've had a big fight over this. What is your opinion?

TITLE: My boyfriend [25M] of a year and I [22F] hardly ever argue, except when we are with his family. I can't figure out why this is happening or how to stop it. Help!
POST: My boyfriend and I have a great relationship.  We communicate well and our conflict resolution styles seem to compliment one another.  We rarely disagree on things, and when we do it's resolved with a simple conversation.

Here's the problem:
When we visit his parents, we argue constantly.  It's really starting to bother me because I can't figure out why it's happening.  I know that his parents see this and think there's no way we are happy together (because his mom has told me).  His parents tend to bicker fairly often, but that shouldn't impact our communication, should it?  It doesn't matter if it's just his parents, or if it's the whole extended family.  We just seem to argue so much more in their presence.  The only exception being when it's just us with his brother and SIL.  I've also noticed that they (brother and SIL) seem to be holding back from arguing with one another while we're with the whole family, and they are not like this when it's just the 4 of us.

I don't know if it's the stress of seeing his family - I know that they don't *love* us together (probably because we're always arguing!).  Or if the family's communication style impacts us.  Or if it's just that I'm stressed and little things bother me, and we can't have our simple resolving conversations while we're there.

Any ideas what could be causing it?  Or how we can stop it from happening?
