"['SUBREDDIT: r/relationships\nTITLE: Me [20/F] having trouble with boyfriend [23/m] of 2.5 years sex drive\nPOST: My boyfriend and I have an amazing sex life. We are very sexually compatible.\n\nAlthough, his sex drive is crazy high compared to mine. It really depends on the time of month for me [hormones], sometimes I\'ll be down to go 3 times a day and sometimes I\'m only interested in once a week. \n\nI\'m asking for advice because I have a hard time denying him without him feeling rejected by me. For example, every time we cuddle he is almost always coming on to me. At night he comes on to me, in the middle of the night he masturbates next to me, and tries to come onto me in the morning. I\'m utterly flattered that after being in a relationship this long he is still very turned on by me, but sometimes it is very overwhelming to keep up with his sexual needs. \n\nI\'ve been trying more to just give him a HJ or BJ if he is really frisky and I\'m not, but sometimes I really am just emotionally drained from life and just want to be cuddled. I\'ve explained this to him several times and he gets very frustrated and defensive and states he doesn\'t feel like I want to please him....which is not the case at all. I can see how sometimes he would feel this way because when he asks sometimes my ""tone"" may come across annoyed or uninterested. I don\'t want him to feel this way and it has been a problem for a while now. \nI want to learn how to approach his needs better without him feeling rejected, and I want us both to be happy.\nTL;DR:']", What techniques can be used to create a safe space to communicate openly about sexual desires and boundaries?,"This is generic answer as relevant information could not be obtained.

I  moved in with Austin's family because my parents out of state and I decided to take some time off from the college where we met. I worked through a terrible depression which has been persistent for the past few years. I isolated myself so now I am friendless, jobless and have no transportation. I am trying to put my life back together and after long reflection, I have realized Austin and I are two very different people. There is a general lack of communication and respect for the other person. So here is my dilemma: Do I  break up with Austin?\n\n I am a very open, honest person. It feels deceitful not to inform him of the decision I have made about our relationship,but I feel a little justified considering how inattentive and neglectful he can be. I want to tell him but he will be unsympathetic and he owes me nothing. Austin would not let me stay here until I have my life together. I have an older sister across the country but we have not talked in years. The whole reason she moved away is to get away from our crazy family. \n\nMy older brother (let's call him Steve) seems to think I should move back in with our alcoholic/codependent parents where he currently lives. Steve is much better at dealing with their bullshit and I don't feel like it's the right environment to figure out my future. They are the source of my depression. I would however like to be close Steve. Having counseling resources available is another good reason to move back, though transportation is an another issue.\n\n It would be great relieve for both Austin and  myself to unburden ourselves with this dead relationship and move on.
