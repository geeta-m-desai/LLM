We had more open discussions about various things that we were going through/had gone through.\n\nI thought my situation was pretty bad, but it was nothing compared to what she had gone through.

Ive practiced the lie that i'd tell my dad and i think i can get away with it, but i might not... and to be clear, this isn't asking for moral advice, everyone in the house would still have the same privileges, im not screwing anyone over, this would simply be to allow me to watch netflix (With headphones) past 10... Does r/ advice thing i could do it without getting caught? and if i do get caught, is it worth the punishment (Grounded, definitely no internet past 10.)\nTL;DR:""]", How can the house be kept in balance so that everyone has the same privileges while still allowing the individual to watch Netflix past 10 o'clock?, Modify settings on the modem to bypass the parental controls time block.
