I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

I\'ll call that my ""batshit crazy"" period. \n\nI lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn\'t there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.\n\nIt also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.', 'It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.\n\nAnyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.\n\nPlus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.\n\nBut I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can\'t forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me.', 'Plus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.\n\nI\'ve scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. \n\nMy question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.\n\nThank you in advance, Reddit.\nTL;DR:']","

But she had been relentlessly trying to contact me after I cut off contact without giving her a reason. \n\nSo today I emailed her detailing everything she had done including the emotional neglect and abuse of myself and other family members and of her interfering and trying to end the relationship between myself and my husband on numerous occasions, and of ignoring my mental illness and making me suffer it out for years as a child, plus multiple other things I can go into if requested.', ""The thing is now I can't help but feel guilty despite everyone patting me on the back and me knowing it was needed for closure. She has conditioned me to feel extreme guilt if I go against her wishes etc.\n\nAs many people with Borderline parents know, the parents sometimes don't realise they have a problem despite the diagnosis of a mental illness (she thinks it's everyone else who is crazy, not her). So I know she will deny everything I have told her, yet she will play the victim as usual and somehow it will get back to me and I will again feel terribly guilty.\n\nAnyway I am just wondering if anyone has experience with borderline parents or other relationships and how they coped with the guilt of confronting the person, or how they coped at all with the stress of the situation. I'm in a rush so I'm sorry if I've left heaps out, I'm new to reddit as well so getting used to the layout, but I can add more details if requested.\nTL;DR:""]","

He\'s not cheating and I\'m sure of that, he\'s a good guy.  \n\nAm I wrong for waiting for him to text me and just initiate more contact?

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?\nPOST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).\n\nMy income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.  Budgeting as best we can for rent, car, phones, utilities, groceries, and other routine expenses come out to around $3,000/month.  It does not cover things like trips, car repair, and other incidental expenses.\n\nWe have around $10,000 in savings, but half of that is owed to my parents over the next few months (interest free loan to help us move to my new job location).\n\nThe issue is that my wife is currently pregnant with our first (any day now) and therefore decided not to continue her position as a teacher at the end of last school year (which paid around $43,000/year).  Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  \n\nSince we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.  With her working, the student loan payments would not be a huge issue, but with only my income, they seriously cut down on what is left after routine and incidental expenses.  \n\nWe have the option to get either reduced or graduated payments, which would lower our combined repayment to around $900-1000 a month.

"['SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: I feel like my dad is cheating me out of a large amount of money. What do?\nPOST: I\'m currently 17. I lived with my dad my entire life. My mom died in 2009 and I began receiving social security checks every month for about $600. In November (2010) part of our house burnt down and we got an insurance check for around $20,000. \n\nNow, my dad is not a poor guy. He makes about $30 an hour full time, and has a girlfriend who works full time as well. However, he always tells me how ""broke"" he is, and how he can\'t afford anything. I think this is complete bull shit. He shops at the expensive grocery store, always eats out, and buys himself expensive toys like motorcycles. And he is not in any debt. \n\nA few months ago I began to ask him about the social security check and the insurance money. He told me that he was able to take care of me financially (as in buying food, health insurance, etc.), but the only thing he can\'t afford is my car insurance. So basically, he\'s saying that the only part of my social security check that is being used on me is for car insurance. So where the hell is the rest of the $600 going? He doesn\'t even pay for my phone bill, gas, or clothes. This I have to pay for myself, even though I have no income. Actually, he did buy me a HALF tank of gas once. But his girlfriend told him not to do that anymore. I feel like she\'s in on this too. \n\n As for the insurance money, we got the check in about January and I have not seen a cent of it. I believe I lost about $700 worth of stuff in the fire, and only one thing has been replaced. He agreed to buy me a new computer instead of giving me money, which I agreed to.  NOW, he\'s saying I need to give him $300 and then he will buy me a computer. \n\nThen my cat got sick. The bill was around $600 and now he\'s saying that I need to pay him. (My cat is still living with him, unfortunately.)\n\nOur relationship has been particularly rocky lately. But\nTL;DR:']","

She worked there for a few months after I got hired, then moved onto a different career path. But was still a part of the social circle I was a part of. I had a huge crush on her soon after, she did not reciprocate that feeling. I was a little sour about it, but decided to remain cordial to her as she was still in my immediate social circle. \n\nFast forward a few years, we had each gone off and dated other people, but also grew to become close friends through out this time. Then about two months ago, after a few drinks together, she out of the blue kisses me, thus spawns our relationship. \n\nAs you can see, I had some mixed feelings about this, as i don\'t really appreciate being the ""ace up some ones sleeve"". But I chose to pursue this because I had to at least try.  Things are fine for a few weeks, we dated pretty casually, saw each other once or twice a week at most. Then she started to grow distant, like she didn\'t ever have any time to see me etc. After it had been almost three weeks since I had seen her or even had a meaningful conversation with her I confronted her about it. After arguing via text message for a few days, I understood that she just wanted a much more casual relationship than what I had wanted. I told her that this relationship wasn\'t going to make either of us happy since we want different things out of it. She agreed and we both decided to remain friends, as there wasn\'t any animosity towards each other. \n\nI felt it was a necessary decision at the time, but after a few days have passed, I feel like I may have done the wrong thing for the right reasons, and that I have thrown away a chance to be in a decent relationship with some one I enjoy.\nTL;DR:']","

I was pissed, so i just plugged into my ethernet and looked up ways to bypass the system.  I found out that i can get into the modem and control it, i am at the last step before i get put in charge of the whole houses Wife, i wouldnt be a dick, i would only remove the time block settings. i dont know whether or not to do it.  Ive practiced the lie that i\'d tell my dad and i think i can get away with it, but i might not... and to be clear, this isn\'t asking for moral advice, everyone in the house would still have the same privileges, im not screwing anyone over, this would simply be to allow me to watch netflix (With headphones) past 10... Does r/ advice thing i could do it without getting caught? and if i do get caught, is it worth the punishment (Grounded, definitely no internet past 10.)\nTL;DR:']","

We didn't have a crazy break up, we were both so numb and exhausted that we just said this is it and kind of drifted away after I moved out.  But we still were kind and respectful to each other.  I think of him often and what he's doing, hope the best for him.  He got in touch with me on Friday and I went to his house on Sunday.  We both have new dogs and we took them to the levee nearby (we live in south Louisiana) to run.  We didn't do anything physical, just had a long hug when I left.  But it's left me in a state of confusion.  Part of me misses him a lot because we were good friends and were there for each other when a lot of crazy shit was happening.  But part of me knows that he is too intense and I'm really not equipped to emotionally handle him without throwing myself into depression and anxiety.  I know I got closure from the experience, but I don't think it was the closure I wanted/expected.  Part of me still hopes we can be together one day, but now I'm more aware than ever that it probably will never happen (and that's probably a good thing).  I've never been the type to play with fire, but for the first time I want to ignore what I know about us as couple and try it again (because when we were good, we were AMAZING).\nTL;DR:""]","

It was intimidating because I know I will continue to make them.\n\nI have worked the job I have for eight months, sort of. I was in logistics for 7 months. Then got moved to sales as a supervisor in January, which are really two totally different careers. But not to my GM. He asserted that after 8 months I should have all the mistakes out of my system.\n\nOther than that I do very well. My sales are great. My customer service is top rated. I solved or diffused any number of problems daily in logistics. Of course, the one you miss is the one that gets noted, but that\'s just how it works.\n\nFact: I\'m not detail oriented. I have to write everything down. My mind naturally moves to big picture questions and goes into auto-pilot fog when it\'s looking at data or double checking numbers. Sometimes I just straight up forget things.\n\nSo what is a reasonable expectation for an employee? Is human error okay? Does it just happen?

Which leads me to the pickle I\'m in - I don\'t really know very much about motorcycles and what would be a good first bike.

I'm not looking for a sport-bike or something that's going to race, I just want to get from Point A to Point B without breaking my neck, but also looking kinda cool (i.e. NOT A SCOOTER). I've got about $2,000 to spend on the bike since there's a good chance I'll screw it up during the learning process. Any ideas or bikes you want to sell me?\n\nThanks!\nTL;DR:""]","

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/personalfinance\nTITLE: Should we adjust our high student loan repayments while my wife stays home with the kids?\nPOST: My wife and I both have pretty large amounts of student loans ($72,000 for my PhD, $83,000 for her 2 Master's), which are all Federal Direct Stafford Loans.  The payments on these loans together will come to around $1,780/month, once I am out of deferment (I just finished school a couple months ago).\n\nMy income is $100,000/year, which comes out to around $2,950/biweekly after all taxes and insurance.  I also have the potential to get an incentive bonus of $8,000/year, depending on my performance and the performance of my company.

Our plan is to have her stay home with our child until he and any subsequent children are old enough to attend full day preschool.  \n\nSince we would like 1-2 more, this will mean that she will not be working for the next 6-8 years.

The girl in my school now found out from a kid. that mostly everyone doesn\'t like, that ""I have a picture of a nip slip, work on yearbook and prom commity, (which i don\'t) and showed everyone."" \nWhat should i do, I already told the girl that i am not involved with anything and that the kid is basically making it all up.\nShould i ""throw him under the bus"", just as he did to me, or should i just leave it alone now.\nTL;DR:']","

Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that it is illegal to threaten or emotionally abuse your partner.
