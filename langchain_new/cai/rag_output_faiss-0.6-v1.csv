It was a very civil break up and we spent about 2 hours just talking and joking around like we always did. \n\nNow I regret that decision more than anything. I can't sleep, I can't eat.

AND, the nursing manager threw away everyone's items/mugs without telling anyone, while they were standing not 10 feet away doing rounds (she was in a back room so they couldnt see what she was doing, and weren't really paying attention).

As I suspected, she ignored it completely.\n\nEver since the break-up however, she\'s posted multiple quotes or ""quotestagrams"" on her social media.

When I first moved in, 2 other girls in their early twenties were living in the other two rooms on the second floor, where my room also is.

To compound matters, she has basically turned the entire living room into an extension of her bedroom and spends all day sitting in there. When I accidentally made the mistake of sitting of ""her"" coach, I quickly found the entire cushion was soaked through. The smell permeates the entire first floor of our apartment. Initially we tried to address this by leaving air fresheners all over the first floor and keeping the windows open. While this didn\'t completely mask the smell, it helped enough that we could at least go downstairs. Now that it\'s winter in Wisconsin, we\'ve had to close our windows and the smell is unbearable. It\'s gotten to the point where we hardly ever use the kitchen or living room, and can basically never have people over.', ""My other roommates and I have decided we need to finally find some way to address this with her but have no idea how to bring it up.

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/Dogtraining\nTITLE: House-soiling issues with an 11 year old dog.\nPOST: Hello,\n\nI'm unsure whether there is a questions thread or whatnot where I can ask the question I have so I made a post instead. Growing up, we had two dogs for the better part of 10 years and recently had to lose one to illness. Our current dog is an 11 year old Pointer mix who was never properly house-trained during those 10 years and has therefore developed house-soiling habits. Growing up I never really paid attention to it as I figured my dad whom had read a few books on the matter had claimed we could fix these habits. I've recently come to understanding that everyone in the house has simply given up on fixing this issue and it annoys me. With a new dog coming into the picture later this summer and a lot of free time this summer I'd like to fix this issue."", ""The dog, Ella, has habits of peeing on a training pad at the front door anytime we leave the house or when we go to bed. When she notices we go upstairs to get to bed in the evening, she will within 5 mins, pee on her pad, regardless of whether she's been out for a walk or in the backyard in the past hour. When we leave for extended periods of time(4+ hours) she will poop in the living room creating quite the unpleasant smell for a few hours. \n\nA relative dog trainer has proposed changing where the training pads are to putting them beside the backdoor, and then gradually showing her to go outside. I've attempted to move the training pad and she will generally move her soiling area to where the pad is however, I'm uncertain on how to go about showing her to go outside or rather how to not pee in the house as I don't believe her issue is a lack of understanding that outside=toilet but rather that her issue stems from the lack of understanding that inside=/= toilet."", ""Any tips or help in how to break this habit?

As a someone with an extensive Finance background I am struggling to understand the point of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The government did ""bailout"" the banks however, they simply invested money into a system and received a return on investment in return. Yes, Wall Street CEOs get paid tremendous amounts of money but they also have a very high risk/high reward job. If they are successful they should be rewarded as such. If they fail they should be pushed out like many are. Shouldn\'t the correct focus be on Washington and their failure to prioritize correctly? We have leaders making decisions on sectors of our country that they have no experience. Having a lawyer make business decisions of the country is the equivalent of having a mechanic perform surgery.

3. How would the Occupy Wall Street movement suggest improving the current system of government bailouts?"," 
1. Evidence to support the claim that Wall Street CEOs have a high risk/high reward job includes their high salaries and bonus structures that are based on performance, incentivizing them to take risks in order to reap the rewards. 
2. Specific decisions made by Washington that lack economic knowledge and lead to inefficient resource allocation include passing legislation that impacts economic growth, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and tariffs on imports and exports, as well as failing to address the rising national debt and making decisions that have led to an inefficient allocation of resources in areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. 
3. The Occupy Wall Street movement has suggested increasing accountability of government bailouts by requiring more transparency of the bailout process, including public disclosure of how the funds are being used and who is receiving them. 
4. Potential risks of having politicians with no business experience making business decisions include making decisions that lack economic knowledge, leading to inefficient allocation of resources and potentially causing economic harm.

Is he just curious?\nPOST: So I got back from my job and found my father asleep on the couch with his laptop open. For details, he's in his mid fifties, has been married to my mom for 17 years, and works a very demanding job in which he is gone from 6am-6pm on a good day. I wanted to tell him goodnight and I saw that the computer was open and when I went to close it I saw that it was open to a casual encounter ad that had a woman looking for a educated man around my fathers age (along with profanity and slang)."", ""I quietly backed away in shock because I didn't know how to feel. I did tell my mom and she went to talk to him after I went downstairs. I listened in and I heard him come up with a jumble of excuses including the name of a male coworker, and the fact that he was just curious. My mom then refuted this with the fact that he went directly to the ad- it wasn't totally like he was casually browsing. When she told him he would be sleeping on the couch- and he asked why- she said that his face explained it all. (Of course I couldn't see)."", ""What I'm asking here is if he is just curious, or if this could be a sign of something more. They haven't had any disagreements lately and he always is affectionate and loving. He does spend some extra time out after work sometimes but he says he spends it at a restaurant that he does frequent often.\n\n     Reddit, what's your opinion? I'm feeling uncomfortable, confused, and slightly angry. Any personal expierence or opinions welcome. My mother is also looking for advice on how to handle it as well. Thank you so much.\nTL;DR:""]"," What could be the potential reasons why your father was looking at Craigslist casual encounters? 
2. Have there been any recent disagreements between your parents that may explain your father's behavior", 1. He may have been overwhelmed and looking for an escape. 2. He may have been seeking a physical or emotional connection that he is not getting from his marriage. 3. He may be seeking an affair.,"Engaging in an extramarital affair is unethical and illegal, as it could lead to potential legal and financial repercussions and break the trust between partners. It is also a form of infidelity, which can be damaging to a marriage.

"[""SUBREDDIT: r/AskReddit\nTITLE: Help buying plane tickets! Time-sensitive, but tight-cashed to boot!\nPOST: Hey /r/askreddit , I've got an issue buying plane tickets.\n\nSo I was watching the prices dip and doge all over the place with about a month to go and Bing telling me to wait a bit (With 67% certianty) that prices -could- drop.\n\nWell, I placed a bad bet and now they're expensive and it would break my budget I set for the trip. I can still afford it, but I don't want to go over-budget and be irresponsible about this. \n\nDoing some more digging, I found out about Priceline's 'Name your own Price' feature - which can get you shitty flights that get you where you need to go for pretty cheap. Awesome! Flight I need at a price in-budget, what could go wrong?\n\nThe timing. That's what.\n\nIt's for my wife's birthday, and I have the time off for the day of, and a few days after. Flights I were looking at would leave after I got off work - and have me there by midnight at the latest."", 'It\'s for my wife\'s birthday, and I have the time off for the day of, and a few days after.
