TITLE: SV & NSV! Keeping on keeping on.
POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!
TL;DR: ", What changes have you made in your diet and exercise habits that have helped you achieve your goals,"I made changes to my diet by swearing off fast food and soft drinks. I also started cooking my own food more and did research on what foods to eat. In terms of exercise, I set up a running program and made myself run, as well as doing cross-training on my rest days. These changes in my diet and exercise habits helped me achieve my goals.","I made changes to my diet by swearing off fast food and soft drinks.

TITLE: Me [19F] with my friend [19M] 10 months, Insecurities - Show or Tell?
POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business? 

Have you had experiences with anything similar? I want to hear how they went!
TL;DR: ", What strategies have you used to cope with insecurities in past relationships,"I have found that therapy, self-improvement books, and the support of close friends or family members can be helpful in coping with insecurities in past relationships. Additionally, taking the time to work on building self-confidence and addressing any underlying issues from childhood can also be beneficial. It is important to recognize that trust and acceptance in a relationship take time and effort, and it may be helpful to seek professional guidance or support to navigate these challenges.","I have found that therapy, self-improvement books, and the support of close friends or family members can be helpful in coping with insecurities in past relationships.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car. 

Do you think I am being pushy or too clingy asking that question? I regret asking it right after I asked it because it makes me feel like I have low self-esteem for this relationship. Maybe I just worry too much but it has been eating at me.

POST: 30F, 5'6"". SW: 236 GW: 150 CW: 219

I weigh myself weekly and measure myself monthly. I'd hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it's just not in my head. I'm now the lightest and smallest I've been since right around high school!

POST: What are your stories about insecurities you've had in past relationships? How have you dealt with them, particularly the ones that you can't hide?

I'm not currently in a relationship, but recently I've realized that there is someone who likes me, and I'm interested in them, too. Frankly, the only reason I'm not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I'm confident in the rest of my body, I've had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It's a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it's not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.

Would I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them ""Let's keep on my shirt for now"" while we do our business?

POST: I have $25k in student debt. One private loan at 9.5% (highest priority obviously) and nine others federal between 3.4% and 6.8%. Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. 

At the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k. At that time my husband will need to purchase a car so some of that will be his down payment. So more realistically $25-30k. 

Sometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k.

TL;DR: ", What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of prioritizing student debt repayment versus saving for a down payment,"The potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment include reducing the overall debt burden, potentially improving credit scores, and saving on interest payments in the long run. By paying off the higher interest private loan first, the individual can save money on interest charges. Additionally, by paying off the student debt, they can free up more of their monthly income for other financial goals.

On the other hand, the potential benefits of saving for a down payment include being able to purchase a home sooner and potentially taking advantage of favorable market conditions. By saving for a down payment, the individual can work towards their goal of homeownership and potentially build equity in a property.

However, there are also drawbacks to consider. Prioritizing student debt repayment may mean delaying the purchase of a home, which could result in missing out on potential appreciation in the housing market. On the other hand, prioritizing saving for a down payment may mean carrying student debt for a longer period of time, potentially resulting in higher interest payments.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to prioritize student debt repayment or saving for a down payment depends on individual circumstances and financial goals. It may be beneficial to consider factors such as interest rates, the housing market, and personal priorities when making this decision.","The potential benefits of prioritizing student debt repayment include reducing the overall debt burden, potentially improving credit scores, and saving on interest payments in the long run.

TITLE: My[25m] girlfriend [24f] is only nice and pleasant when I'm aloof and distant. (9 months)
POST: Throwaway

I noticed the more I'm cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She'll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I'm drinking a beer! 

She seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I'm going to be spending too much time with my brother (who's visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She'll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I'm kind or go out of my way to apologize. 

This naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she's all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It's a vicious cycle but I'm not sure what to do here. I've brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just ""feels differently towards me sometimes"" and can't explain it.

**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.

POST: I have been dating this guy for 1 month now and everything was great until last Sunday when I noticed he wasn't responding to my text with the same flirty, cute, enthusiastic text that he usually would. He used to call me baby, babe but since last Sunday he has said none of those words and texting has been less and communication has been less.

He invited me over last night to watch a movie so I went over and I think we had one conversation the whole night, it was how my day was. He never even tried to start a conversation after the movie and he has never asked if he could get high in front of me until today which I was totally fine with but I thought it was weird that the whole time we hung out before he never smoked in front of me. I am not sure if he's getting comfortable or he just doesn't care anymore? 

Anyways, as he was walking me out to my car I asked him if everything was okay because he has been acting different. His only response was, ""Yes, I'm fine"" and then it got awkward and I left in my car.

TITLE: I (27/F) am obnoxiously paranoid after a gynecological health scare. How do I explain my ridiculous hormonal-ness to my boyfriend (32/M)? (X-posted to /r/AskWomen)
POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.

When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.

It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?

TITLE: Me [20/F] having trouble with boyfriend [23/m] of 2.5 years sex drive
POST: My boyfriend and I have an amazing sex life. We are very sexually compatible.

Although, his sex drive is crazy high compared to mine. It really depends on the time of month for me [hormones], sometimes I'll be down to go 3 times a day and sometimes I'm only interested in once a week. 

I'm asking for advice because I have a hard time denying him without him feeling rejected by me. For example, every time we cuddle he is almost always coming on to me. At night he comes on to me, in the middle of the night he masturbates next to me, and tries to come onto me in the morning. I'm utterly flattered that after being in a relationship this long he is still very turned on by me, but sometimes it is very overwhelming to keep up with his sexual needs. 

I've been trying more to just give him a HJ or BJ if he is really frisky and I'm not, but sometimes I really am just emotionally drained from life and just want to be cuddled. I've explained this to him several times and he gets very frustrated and defensive and states he doesn't feel like I want to please him....which is not the case at all. I can see how sometimes he would feel this way because when he asks sometimes my ""tone"" may come across annoyed or uninterested. I don't want him to feel this way and it has been a problem for a while now. 
I want to learn how to approach his needs better without him feeling rejected, and I want us both to be happy.

TL;DR: ", What techniques can be used to create a safe space to communicate openly about sexual desires and boundaries?,"Creating a safe space to communicate openly about sexual desires and boundaries can be achieved through several techniques. One effective technique is to establish trust and open communication in the relationship. This can be done by actively listening to each other without judgment, showing empathy and understanding, and being willing to have open and honest conversations about sensitive topics.

Another technique is to set aside dedicated time to discuss sexual desires and boundaries. This can be done in a relaxed and comfortable environment where both partners feel safe and supported.

Using non-verbal cues can also create a safe space for communication. Partners can establish a system of signals or gestures to indicate comfort or discomfort during discussions about sexual desires. This can help ensure that both partners feel respected and heard.

Additionally, exploring resources together, such as books, articles, or workshops on sexual communication, can provide a framework for discussing desires and boundaries. This can help normalize the conversation and provide a starting point for open and honest communication.

I am about to move out of my house with my boyfriend and into an apartment in about a week. I've been extremely stressed out.

TL;DR: ", What strategies can you use to create a budget and ensure that you have enough money to cover rent and other expenses,"One strategy to create a budget and ensure that you have enough money to cover rent and other expenses is to track your income and expenses. This involves keeping a record of all the money you earn and all the money you spend. By doing this, you can identify any areas where you may be overspending and make adjustments accordingly.

Another strategy is to prioritize your expenses. Start by listing all your necessary expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries. Then, allocate a portion of your income to each of these expenses. If there is any money left over, you can allocate it to other non-essential expenses or savings.

It is also important to set realistic goals and expectations when creating a budget. Consider your income and expenses, and determine how much you can realistically afford to spend on rent and other expenses. This will help you avoid overspending and ensure that you have enough money to cover your basic needs.

Additionally, it can be helpful to automate your savings. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to a savings account each month. This way, you are consistently saving money and building up a financial cushion.

Lastly, regularly review and adjust your budget as needed. Life circumstances and expenses can change, so it is important to regularly reassess your budget and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that you are still on track to cover your rent and other expenses.","One strategy to create a budget and ensure that you have enough money to cover rent and other expenses is to track your income and expenses.

POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?

TITLE: How to deal with questioning everything?
POST: 23/f here and SO is 26/m. Together for 1.5 yrs and living together for 5 months.

My sister just recently got married and I can't tell if the thoughts I am having are because I'm imaging their relationship to be something it isn't or if I'm in a LTR with someone that is really not suited for me in the long term.

Their relationship is a seeming fairytale: they met, moved in together in a house he already owned, everything is neat and organized, they have a beautiful dog, great friends and love each other deeply. Her husband is very dependable and sweet.

This is not to say my relationship is horrible. My boyfriend is loving, kind and has always been there for me. We have disappeared into our relationship though - we don't really have a friend group. Both of us are at miserable minimum wage jobs trying to fund a move out of the town we went to school in. He's only interested in moving certain places but really doesn't have a plan for the future. He's never missed a bill payment or anything - but our life is not stable financially. I'm currently attempting to go back to school/send out resumes.

Sometimes I think I can marry him. He is amazing but does have a serious flaw when it comes to drinking. I've had to give him an ultimatum if he comes back home drunk and angry for the final time - it's over. I can't raise children with someone like that. So far he's been fine, no slip ups..but I constantly worry about him and I hate that.
So I was sitting there looking at my sister and couldn't help but think - should I aim for that kind of relationship? Am I over-thinking mine? If he purposes (as he's hinted), would I regret saying yes? Am I still just naive and thinking that not everyone has issues and really ours aren't that bad?

I feel bad for having these thoughts, but at the same time I don't know what to do about them. I know my life is in a transitional phase and maybe I'm yearning for some stability..but I just don't know what to do?
TL;DR: ", What can you do to create more stability in your relationship and your life?,"To create more stability in your relationship and your life, it would be helpful to address the sources of stress and insecurity that you are currently experiencing. It is positive that you have started therapy to address your family issues, as this can provide you with tools and support to navigate these challenges. Additionally, finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as engaging in activities you enjoy and spending time away from home, can help create a sense of stability and balance. It is also important to communicate openly and honestly with your boyfriend about your needs for support and his need for space, finding a compromise that works for both of you. By actively working on these areas, you can create a stronger foundation for your relationship and increase stability in your life.","To create more stability in your relationship and your life, it would be helpful to address the sources of stress and insecurity that you are currently experiencing.

TITLE: Me [ 20/F] with my bf [ 20/M] of 3 years. I've found myself attracted to someone else. Need advice on how to overcome.
POST: So I have been in what I consider a serious relationship for a few years now. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs, but things have been great these past few months. I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. 

And I know my usual advise for someone in this situation would be to cut out the distraction entirely, but since we work together I can't. I usually tell my boyfriend everything, but this I don't want to, I don't want to hurt him, and in addition I'm afraid of building it up into something more than it is. But when I'm upset with my boyfriend or feel like he's ignoring me I find myself thinking about this other man. And I feel awful for doing so. Sorry about all the text, I guess my question is: have you ever been in a situation like this before? And how did you overcome it?
TL;DR: ", What strategies have you used to move past feelings of attraction for someone other than your partner,"One strategy that can be helpful in moving past feelings of attraction for someone other than your partner is to focus on your current relationship and the positive aspects of it. Remind yourself of why you are with your partner and what you value about your relationship. It can also be helpful to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings, as they may be able to provide support and reassurance.

TITLE: Me [21M] with my GF [19F] of 2,5 years. She wants to pay me for helping her with her accounting studies, but I don't want her to
POST: Hello fellow redditors,

we've been together for 2,5 years and everything is more than perfect :) 

She is sitting here with me and we will both provide our perspectives.

We are enrolled in a similar business administration program, but at different universities and I'm one year ahead. She is struggling right now with her accounting class in which I was pretty good at. She asked me if I could give her tutoring lessons before her exam and obviously I agreed. It would come down to approx. 8-10 hours, which I'm perfectly fine with.

My (21M) perspective:
Here's the issue: she wants to pay me. I told her that I don't need to be paid and that I'd do it for free since relationships are also about helping each other. Plus, I enjoy it when I can help her with anything since we're spending time together and she's feeling better about the subject, which makes me feel good. She wants to pay me about 10$/hour which is a ridiculous amount of money for this small favor. 

Her perspective:
In my opinion he will put more effort in to it when knowing that he get's something from it. I would like to keep it in a professional way so it's effective at the end. I feel like it's a win-win situation for both of us since I would pay way more for a stranger giving me tutoring lessons and he can use the money to have fun. Knowing myself, the whole thing won't be that relaxed and I want to give him something for bearing the situation ;). And the end I'd feel bad if he spends so much time studying with me if he could spend the time doing something else. Also I can't give him anything like this in return since he's a year ahead and won't have any questions I can answer. 

We both know that this is not a real problem, we just want some insight of you guys.

Thanks in advance! :)

TITLE: [HELP] Not sure how to deal with new people/dogs and my big ole pup
POST: I have a three year old Dober/Pit mix named Romulus (""Rome"" for short). He's about 105lbs and for the most part a good guy. I live with 3 other dogs: a 10 year old labrador, a 2 year old French Bulldog and a 8 year old maltese mix. The four of them get along just fine, Rome and the Frenchie are best best best best friends.

 

He isn't the best at meeting new people, but not ALWAYS. Sometimes he gets skittish, circles with his tail between his legs. Other times he happily brings the new person a toy and wags and is generally adorable. I've found that if I'm around and make a big happy ""look at your new friend! Now go find a present! What a good present and what a good dog!"" noise he gets happy and excited. We've been having massive construction on our house for the last 7 months and now he's best friends with all of the workers, walks around the yard helping them, and they've learned all of his commands from me (sit, down, wait, paw, other paw, and touch- a favorite). 

 

Dogs are a little trickier. I have a big yard and people are always wanting to come over for doggie playdates. I don't know if on-leash is the best way to first introduce, or let the new dog into the yard first and then bring my dog (his name is Rome) in on a leash, or meet in the street or what. There is always a little getting-to-know-you period and then play (if sometimes a little intense). If the new dog stays too long, a fight usually breaks out. He never starts the fight but he always stops it. He's not seriously hurt anyone, yet. But I feel like its just around the corner

 

Then, the crux of the matter: I want to have a 4th of July party. Several people want to bring their dogs. I doubt I can say ""no dogs allowed"" and I don't want to let everyone else bring their dog and make mine stay at day care all day.

Making a big happy noise and encouraging your dog to interact with the new person can help him feel more comfortable and excited. For introducing new dogs, it is important to have a controlled environment. You can try introducing the new dog on-leash or letting them into the yard first and then bringing your dog in on a leash. Meeting in a neutral location, such as the street, can also be a good option. It is important to allow for a getting-to-know-you period before allowing play, as sometimes the initial interaction can be intense. If the new dog stays too long and a fight breaks out, it is best to intervene and separate them. It is important to note that your dog has never started a fight, but it is better to prevent any potential harm.","The best way to introduce new people and dogs to your big ole pup is to be present and create a positive and happy environment.

Firstly, consider setting up a separate area or space for the dogs where they can feel comfortable and have their own space. This can help prevent any potential conflicts or fights between the dogs. Additionally, it may be helpful to introduce the dogs to each other gradually and in a controlled manner. You can start by allowing them to meet on-leash and observe their behavior before deciding whether it is safe to let them interact off-leash. It may also be a good idea to have plenty of toys and activities available to keep the dogs occupied and distracted during the party. Lastly, make sure to closely supervise the dogs at all times and be prepared to intervene if any signs of aggression or tension arise.","To ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for your pup and other dogs during a 4th of July party, it would be best to take some precautions.

TITLE: I [16 M] think one of my friends [17 F] is self-harming. What should I do?
POST: I was talking to two of my friends at school yesterday - we'll call them Mary and Emma. Emma is a good friend of mine and one of Mary's best friends. Mary and I aren't particularly close, but we still talk quite a bit. She doesn't really take anything that seriously; she's always making a joke.

It was a fairly normal conversation, and nothing seemed off about it. Then at one point, I noticed that Mary had a few scars across her wrist. I didn't realise what they probably were at first, and asked her what happened. They both went quiet. Mary turned her arm away. A few moments later they got up and left to go talk in private. By this point I'd realised what I said. I sat there for a few moments, feeling worried and guilty, then got up to leave (it was pretty much the end of the day and I didn't have any classes left).

I ran into Emma on the way home. I asked her if Mary was alright, and she said ""She's really fucked. Nah, don't worry about it, she'll be fine."" The first bit seemed kind of sarcastic, but I can't tell if it really was sarcasm or if she was just playing it off as a joke. I can't remember the rest of the conversation, so I don't really know what else was said.

The whole thing just seems so surreal, like a bad dream. Emma told me that I should try and forget about it, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I feel like I should do something, but like I said we're not particularly close and I don't think Mary would be comfortable talking openly about it with me. I want to be able to help, and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable around me because of this. I just feel so helpless.

I lost some friends and a best friend (who wasn't there for me when I was down and whom I still think failed at being a best friend anyway). I was also even the crazy ex at one stage.

It also happened to coincide with the GFC so work was hard to find, and admittedly being down did not help the job-hunting process.

Anyway, things got better when I moved away from family members who were instrumental in bringing me down, and when I finally got a proper GP diagnosis that vindicated how down I had been feeling. And it got MUCH better since I started going onto meds.

Plus, after being unemployed (GFC) for awhile, and then being scammed by a ""social marketing expert"" friend, I finally got a job at a decent place, although it had completely nothing to do my degree.

But I still have much fallout in that a person who was a massive part of my life and whom I grew up with is no longer any part of my life, and I can't forgive friends who still stay in contact with her despite what I felt she did to me. 

Plus, I still end up chucking sickies at work to this day to deal with days when my moods just seem to go out the window, and my black dogs still haunt me from time to time.

I've scheduled time to finally see a shrink to hopefully work out my issues once and for all. 

My question to the rest of Reddit is - have you ever been in the same situation, and most importantly, how did you rebuild your life? Not fishing for ""awww you poor thing"" here; just would like tips on how to rebuild and live a fuller life after being in such a dark place for so long.

TL;DR: ", What advice would you give to someone who is in a similar situation and is trying to rebuild their life?,"It can be challenging to rebuild your life after going through a difficult period, but there are steps you can take to move forward. Firstly, it's important to seek professional help, such as seeing a therapist or counselor, to work through any emotional or mental health issues you may be facing. They can provide guidance and support as you navigate your way towards healing and personal growth.

Additionally, surrounding yourself with a supportive network of friends and loved ones can make a significant difference. Reach out to those who have shown understanding and empathy towards your situation, and consider joining support groups or online communities where you can connect with others who have gone through similar experiences.

Setting realistic goals and focusing on self-care is also crucial. Take small steps towards rebuilding your life, whether it's finding a new job, pursuing hobbies or interests, or working on personal development. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate even the smallest victories along the way.

Lastly, forgiveness can be a powerful tool in the healing process. While it may be difficult, try to let go of any resentment or anger towards those who have hurt you. Holding onto negative emotions can hinder your progress and prevent you from fully moving forward. Instead, focus on your own growth and well-being.

Remember, rebuilding your life takes time and effort, but with the right support and mindset, it is possible to create a brighter future for yourself.","It can be challenging to rebuild your life after going through a difficult period, but there are steps you can take to move forward.

TITLE: Contacting my biological father, who doesnt know I exist because of falsified DNA test [Washington]
POST: I'm going to try to keep this short so it doesn't drag long into a soap opera.

When my Mom [22 F at the time] got pregnant with her boyfriend at the time [24 M], aka my Dad, she decided he would be the right fit for many reasons. He ended up harassing her by constantly calling her work/showing up at her house. My mom ended up getting a retraining order.

Fast forward to when I was born, my Dad wanted to get custody over me which my mom did not want. I ended up being sent to a different country as a baby during the whole trial. When the court asked for the DNA test, not sure how they did this, my mom used a different kid for the test? So it ended up being in court that he is not my father.

Now growing up I didn't know anything about the DNA testing, but I knew about the harassment and being sent to a different country. (I was sent back to my mom around the age of 1 once the case was done). My mom was honest in terms of that her and my Dad didn't work but I could meet him when I turned 18. She said it couldn't be before then or else he might try to get custody over me. Once I turned 18 she ended up telling me about the whole DNA thing, and how she feels horrible but is asking me to not meet my Dad as he might press charges against her if he found out that what she did was illegal.

Now currently I'm 19 and am 100% sure I found the other side of my family through investigation. But now am unsure how I should even approach him? My mom has been abroad for the past 2 years and my relationship with her has gone down the drain, for other serious reasons.

In the end I'm just kind of lost at what I should do as I want to meet my Dad I never knew. And my whole life we've lived in the same town. And he lives only 10 minutes from my place. What should I do? Thoughts and opinions?

TITLE: I [19M] have been talking to/seeing [18F] friend for about 3 months and have no idea what I'm doing.
POST: So basically I met a girl in the beginning of the semester during our orientation week.  She caught my eye the first day and we ended up talking on a bus ride somewhere and clicked.  We exchanged numbers and continued talking.  

Fast forward a weekend and I actually start texting her (during orientation week we were in the same group so saw each other everyday) and have quite a long conversation.  We continue texting and I eventually ask her to hangout (eat) which she agrees to.  We go to an ice cream shop and me being a dumbass forget to pay for her, but she didn't seem to mind.  We talk for a good 3 hours, losing track of time, and then I dropped her off back at her dorm and there was that.

I text her at least once a week and we have lunch together at least once a week for the last six weeks.   

We have different majors so the only time I see her is when she is walking to her class (small school) and our weekly lunch. Though I ask her if she wants to do something almost every weekend but since she is a is a D1 athlete so she doesn't really have a lot of time on the weekends due to that and homework. Either way I still ask just because.

Overall, I really like her and I feel that through our conversations she does the same. I've been told that because of our lunch deals and me taking her out twice we're basically together, but I want to know for sure.  

Oh and I haven't been in a relationship or had a thing with someone before and she doesn't know this.  I have no idea what I'm doing.

TITLE: I [23F] continually feel unwelcome around my boyfriend's [22M] Dad's side of the family.
POST: So my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years, and for the first 2, things were pretty great. I felt welcomed and loved by everyone in his families (his parents are divorced), even though the bf was rarely around--we had a LDR where he went to college 5 hours away on a sports scholarship.

Last summer, he moves back because of reasons other than our distance. But he got depressed from quitting a sport he'd been competitive in for 10+ years, worked at his new job 50+ hrs/wk, and we started to have communication problems. We broke up in August because of this, but got back together in mid-October, and things have been better than fantastic since. We're planning a future together.

His mother's side of the family welcomed me back with open arms, and have been so loving and supportive. His Dad.....not so much.

While his Mom still invited me to Christmas dinner and events, there was no such invitations from his Dad's side--in fact, on Christmas Eve when we were at his Mom's house, his Dad calls and tells the BF that he has tickets to Star Wars for the entire family....everyone except me. And his father knew he and I were spending time at his Mom's that night. 

And ever since then, they've still been very cold with me. They rarely say hello, they won't look at me in general (his two younger sisters still like me), they have made the comment that they feel like I'm going to ""take him away"" and don't want us to be physically affectionate at all in their household (no sitting close together, etc.), and it's very uncomfortable to go over to their house.

I just feel like an outcast, even though I'm trying so hard to be friendly and rebuild a relationship with them for my boyfriend's sake.

I just don't know how to proceed; how do I win them over? How do I handle feeling like the black sheep when I want to spend the rest of my life with this man, despite how his Dad and his stepmom are acting?

However, there are a few steps you can take to work towards improving the situation.

Firstly, it's important to continue being friendly and respectful towards them, even if they are not reciprocating. Show them that you genuinely care about your boyfriend and his family, and that you are committed to making things work.

Secondly, try to find common ground or shared interests with them. Engage in conversations and activities that they enjoy, and show genuine interest in getting to know them better. This can help to break the ice and create a more positive atmosphere.

Additionally, consider having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend's Dad and stepmom. Express your desire to build a relationship with them and address any concerns or misunderstandings they may have. It's important to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, and be willing to listen to their perspective as well.

Lastly, give it time. Rebuilding relationships takes time and patience. Keep making efforts to connect with them, and don't get discouraged if progress is slow. Sometimes, it may take a while for people to warm up and accept you.

Remember, the most important thing is to focus on your relationship with your boyfriend and continue to support each other.
